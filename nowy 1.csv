DERELICTUS - THE CITY BETWEEN|Haven|D4|Any, D10 Derelictus has been a waypoint for travellers between the two cities for centuries. In its centre, the aelfir architects who built the Vermissian com‐ missioned an enormous station to link the City Above and the City Beneath and allow travel between them. Haven sta‐ tion, as it was to be called, was built but never connected to the line. After decades of delays, it was abandoned and the inhabitants of Derelictus moved in. Huge, arching ceilings of broken and filthy glass tower above the central plaza. There are three plat‐ forms that extend downwards into the void below, each housing hundreds of people, and the station continues into the outskirts of Derelictus proper. Here, the racial tensions of Spire are relaxed some‐ what by the interzone feel of the place; aelfir associ‐ atewith–andonoccasionmarry–darkelves. The central platforms form the crux of the City Between, as Derelictus is sometimes called – they cater to delvers, thrill-seekers, occultists, vagabonds andexplorersallkeentodescendintotheHeart. Platform 1 is a warren devoted to the very serious business of selling people things that will help them survive in the Heart. Workshops and traders boast the keenest swords, the warmest coats and the cleanest-burning 136 Landmarks spireblack. The goods for sale are expensive; the owners have a captive audience, after all. Platforms 2 and 3 cater to the baser needs of delvers – the roughest ale, the greasiest food, the cheapest beds and the cheapest company. Finally, platform 4 holds representatives from most of the factions who have a vested interest in Heart exploration. The Vermissian Collective boastsanintactticketofficehere;theHoundshave a recruitment office; and the Gryndel Hunting Clubs offer farewell drinks to members before a delve. Any number of paramilitary, religious, occult or trade-related organisations have offices on the platform, whether publically or not.|Spending a few days in Derel‐ ictus automatically removes all stress from a character’s resistances.|• There’s work to be had for able-bodied people and those who can read and write. Doesn’t pay very well though (D4, Haven). • Various dark magicians kicked out of the City Above but not quite ready for the City Below practice their dark arts on the crumbling streets of Derelictus.If you can break into their hovels you can make off with their valuables – sacrificial animals, sheafs of arcane research notes, scrying-bones and so on (D8, Occult). • Hunting the verminous swine that snuffle through the open sewers here is a popular pastime, and if you get a big one someone will generally buy it off you (D6, Wild).|• Verrex, a shifty retro-technologist with a tumbledown workshop lit by flickering magelights, sends delvers off to rescue an escapedmechanicalcopyofhimself.Whetherit’s real or not is another matter.(D10,Technology) • A mystery cult made up of street kids approaches the party; the leader asks them to rescue his sister after she disappeared into the City Below looking for the Moon Beneath.

THE GOD OF CORPSES|Haven, Religion|D4|• Galen Guides-the-Pulse and Doctor Haverick, Avid Chirurgeons (D10 Blood). • Madb, Rheumy-eyed Hierophant of Ribcage Market (D8 Supplies). This landmark is a huge corpse of no particular beast: a whale, perhaps, or some sort of titanic ox. It died down here, and in dying it became a god. People live in it and worship it, praying that it will keep them alive a little longer. There are Seven Sacred Ailments which it is con‐ sidered good to die from.These are: Weeping Ague, Azur’s Touch,Grackling-Cough,Quivering Buboes, ClutteredLung,DegeneracyoftheBoneandQuick‐ ening Blood. All others are the work of demons of 137 Landmarks sin and must be eradicated. The physick‐ ers here are many, zealous and skilled, but they often take more interest in the disease than the person they’re saving. There is a sect here that seeks to awaken the god: to have it throw off its cthonic shackles and bear them, bodiless and free as a virus, into the heavens. There is another sect who believes that this is heresy, and that to bring it to life would shatter its divinity. They are at quiet war, con‐ cocting diseases and spreading them to one another in the vain hope of gaining power, but at present they seem to have reached a standstill.|• Vial of one of the Seven Sacred Ailments (D8, Religion, Dangerous). • Face-rot Capsule (D6,Cursed,Dangerous.Can be used as a Kill D8, Spread, Ranged, Degenerating, Limited1weaponinapinch.) • Panaceaic Inhaler (D8, Religion)|

It was the hope of the aelfir constructors that travellers on the line could marvel at the crystals as they were illuminatedbyhugespotlightsmountedonthecar‐ riages,but the lights proved too expensive to main‐ tain,andanytimeatrainwentover10milesanhour the stalactites started to fall from the ceiling. Jour‐ neys through Grip Station subsequently came with 138 Landmarks fifteen minutes of agonisingly slow, pitch-black travel accompanied by the “singing” of crystals threatening to detach overhead.

Sole sufferers will turn their flats into mazes with stacks of newspaper and cardboard boxes and hide in the cupboards; get more than ten together and they’ll start building something elaborate and dangerous.Labyrinth is a commune of around a hundred and fifty infected builders who are expanding more and more each year.They swallow up the streets around their lairs and con‐ vert them into maddening mazes riddled with traps, pitfalls and wild beasts. Like many deep- dwellers, they implant animal material into their bodies; elder Labyrinthines have rows and rows of horns on their head, neck and back. People would be happy to leave them alone, but they have an instinctive desire to build their structures around important things – or steal those things and put them deep inside the maze so no-one can reach them. They don’t appear to get any use out of these resources, but instead enjoy “protecting” them from others. This is not a huge problem when their walls stop heartsblood creatures from emerging from a cave, but it’s a serious inconvenience when you return to a haven to find it surrounded by twisting passages and razorwire traps.|Doctors aren’t entirely sure how the Labyrinth disease is transmitted between hosts. It might be blood-borne or air‐ borne, but it could just as likely be a mimetic virus contracted by exposure to mazes. The virus is represented by the fallouts below.|• At least a dozen treasures that vary from D8 to D12 in value and possess the Occult, Cursed or Religion domains.

REDCAP GROVE|Wild|D6|Burnout druid den (D6 Blood/Mind) Druids don’t do well in the City Above; it is a place of rules and walls,science and enlightenment,art and industry. Exposure to the world’s largest metropolis drives them mad after a year or two. A few wild-eyed men and women pray to the spirits of the birds or commune with the majesty of a bee swarm’s hive-mind, but most end up dead or in the City Beneath, where civilisation comes undone and their bestial sides can flourish. The druids of Redcap are,unlike the ones you’d find in your average sacred stone circle or wilder‐ ness grove, unrepentant criminals. Realising that their arcane arts gave them access to a) fast- growing plants,no matter the location,and b) the ability to turn into dangerous predators when they needed to, they established the undercity’s most prolific and best-guarded drug farm and flooded the market with magic mushrooms. Anyone who tried to muscle in on their racket (or who tried to stop them for noble reasons) ended up on the wrong side of a hit squad of half-an‐ imal, half-drow assassins (p. 183). Redcap, which looks to be built upon the ruins of an ancient cathedral, is now a lurid smear of fungal blooms and the air is thick with spores. The druids (and a few ungifted lackeys) keep watch over their stocks of mushrooms and escort shipments up to Red Row in the City Above. On occasion, they also release a few luckless sacri‐ fices into the caverns beneath that they can hunt and kill, ensuring another good harvest as their blood soaks into the porous rock.|Non-druids, or people who aren’t part of the wider organisation,generally aren’t too welcome within Redcap Grove. They’ll tolerate you if you’re buying product, but otherwise you’ll have to sneak in.|• Many different varieties of hallucinogenic mushroomsthatgrowoutofrottentreebarkand dead bodies (D6 –D10,Taboo)|• Someone claiming to work for the government of the City Above (although you never saw any proper identification) has asked you to steal a shipment of mushrooms before they leave for the streets of Red Row. They’ll provide you with the time and place, and you get to keep everything you steal (D8, Taboo) aside from the Redcap Special. • A druid named Versival – big beard, one eye, doesn’t like clothes – cut a deal with a Vermissian Sage who believes that massive amounts of hallucinogenic mushrooms are just thethingtoinspirehisresearch.Versivaldoesn’t like going into the technological hell that is the Vermissian, and rather than embarrass himself in front of his friends,he contracts some delvers to do it instead (D8, Wild).|
RESONANCE CHAMBER FIVE|Occult|D4|Commune with an alien consciousness (D4 Mind) The Deep Apiarists carved a plinth out of solid bedrock and installed a buzzing network of bees in hives that cover the great pillar. They broadcast the hum – the signal that lets the bees commu‐ nicate with one another over great distances – through the resonant structure. Any wandering 140 Landmarks Apiarist will be sure to pay it a visit and commune with the intelligence at its core. The resonance chambers act as a communica‐ tions network for Deep Apiarists. They post mes‐ sages of encouragement and warning for one another, stash supplies and even inter their dead here.

SUMP STATION|Technology, Warren|D4|None. Ancient pumps,several storeys high,used to suck the brackish water out of this place: the walls are porous and unstable, and water would seep in. Now the pumps are long-broken and the fur‐ naces powering them are cold. The station is flooded at least waist-high. The flooding – and the creatures that scud malevolently around the abandoned tracks (Wretches, p. 199) – keep people out, meaning that there are untouched airtight rooms, lockers, tunnels and even a vending machine that are pre‐ sumably full of Vermissian artefacts.The fact that no-one’s been stupid or competent enough to get into them yet doesn’t stop tens of delvers drown‐ ing in here every year.|• Intact vending machine from The Vermissian Company (D12, Awkward). • A box of damp information pamphlets: The Pulse Line and You,Proper Train Etiquette,something purporting to be a timetable that descends into a madman’s prophetic scrawl (D8,Occult)|• Athelren, a jaunty Vermissian Sage, dispatches the delvers to salvage the research notes from a lost exploration team in the bowels of Sump station.

THE TEMPLE OF THE MOON BENEATH|Haven, Religion|D4|• Sister Griswold’s Clinic (D10 Blood) • Altar of Our Many Mothers (D8 Fortune) • Purification Chambers (D6 Echo) Two hundred years ago, the Church of the Moon was driven out of the City Above in a week-long purge of fire and terror by the occupying aelfir forces: it was a relic of the old powers and a threat to the new regime. Battered and burned, the remnants of the church fled to the lawless depths of the Heart and sought to rebuild what they had lost in the darkness of the undercity. Now,centuries later,they have rebuilt their once- glorious temple in the City Beneath. The stones and beams of the structure were smuggled down by pil‐ grims or recreated by blind artisans. The temple stands once more – mismatched and patched together, but surviving. The clerics there will pay handsomelyforpartsoftheoriginalgrandtempleor accuratereproductionsshouldtheybeoffered. After their descent, the drow of the Temple of the Moon began to distrust the sky, believing it to be distant, changeable and uncaring. Their now- useless telescopes were dismantled, and follow‐ ers instead sought wisdom in the true moon they had dreamed of since they arrived in the Heart. This moon dwelled far beneath the earth, a luminous and fecund mistress, of which the flit‐ ting phantom in the heavens was but a pale imit‐ ation. The Church of the Moon Beneath, as it was now called,sent the faithful down into the depths 141 Landmarks searching for more insights and visions from their true goddess. The Temple is one of the largest stable structures in the Heart. Within, it holds offices devoted to the six Damnic virtues: Community, Fury, Grace, Sagacity, Tenacity and Vigilance. There is generally a service, celebration or rite happening at any given time when delvers arrive. All are welcome to share in the majesty of the Moon Beneath should they pay the appropriate tithe or perform sufficient acts of faith.|• Stone chipping from the central altar (D6, Religion) • Assorted saints bones from the ossuary (D4, Religion)|• Sister Griswold, a spider-blooded ex-midwife from the CityAbovewithmorethanherfairshareofairsandgraces, runsaclinichere.Hershipmentsofmedicineandsupplies smuggled out of Spire are being targeted by the druid- gangsters of Redcap Grove; she has put a price on their heads(D12,Religion)butitwon’tbeaneasyjob. • Pilgrims gather here to form parties and visit all six subsidiary temples of the Damnic faith. There’s money in escorting them (D6, Haven per temple), even if it’s often more trouble than it’s worth. That said, if you visit all six subsidiary temples, they say that the Goddess blesses you with her sacred insight (i.e. gain access to the Religion domain and a medium advance of your choice).|
SONDERWOOD – THE TEMPLE OF COMMUNITY|Haven, Religion|D4|None Sonderwood is a run-down, cobbled-to‐ gether temple where the faithful spend their lives devoted to the virtue of Com‐ munity. The inhabitants are too friendly by far, but there’s nothing sinister behind it; no great 142 Landmarks malevolent motive. They’re just terribly lonely and desperate for companionship. They offer room and board in exchange for performing ser‐ vices to the temple and, more importantly, attending hour-long sermons on the benefits of togetherness. Sonderwood is largely empty aside from a few die-hard priests and associated hangers-on who don’t mind the religious spiel. Meeting rooms are stuffed with too many chairs, and libraries of community records detailing births, marriages and deaths crumble into use‐ lessness. The leader of the place, although she’d shy away from adopting such a title, is Chastity Graves: a witch who is experimenting with her arcane powers to unite the inhabitants of the temple in glorious, contractual unity. At present, she is attempting to marry everyone in the church to each other in a move that would at best be frowned upon by her superiors in the Temple of the Moon Beneath.|• A single ancient holy text barely held together with twine and glue, buried under piles of unrelated census information (D12, Religion, Deteriorating).|
CHOLLEROUS – THE TEMPLE OF FURY|Religion|D4|• Back-alley doctor employed by the Hounds, mainly to treat sword wounds (D8 Blood) • Redmoon Place, arms market (D10 Supplies) In Chollerous, the unremarkable career of the Hound Derwent Swake took a dramatic upturn as he found himself the sole survivor of a retributive assault led by the witches of Hallow. Fighting off dozens of blood-mages and their enthralled minions, he kept them out of the church at the centre of the settlement for two days until reinforcements arrived and sent the witches packing. This was a perfect example of the Damnic virtue of Fury, and the temple of Chollerous was regarded as a sacred site for the worshippers of the Moon Beneath. At least, that’s the official story. The truth is that Derwent Swake was blessed by the Moon Beneath in her form as Lekole, the blood moon and bringer of fury. He was filled with such furi‐ ous rage that he slaughtered not only the witches but his squadmates too when they attempted to flee the carnage. Magicked, shot and stabbed at least a dozen times, Swake found himself unable to die.Trailing blood,wearing a floating crown of red light and bearing the limbs of the fallen as weapons, a joint effort between the witches and the Hounds managed to subdue him. The Hounds would go on to twist the story through retelling into what is common wisdom in the sur‐ rounding area today. Also, they kept Swake. His body broken and burned but unable to die, he has been restrained in the catacombs beneath the temple.The faithful visit him to renew their fury by anointing them‐ selves with his ever-flowing blood. Drawing on his power, Chollerous has grown into a stable haven that boasts an extensive arms market, and they provide to any who wish to take destiny into their own hands and strike back at those who have wronged them.

ATHANE – THE TEMPLE OF SAGACITY|Haven, Religion|D4|• Rederan Foxworth, elderly and discreet drug dealer (D6 Mind) • Van Jastobaal, polymath market trader (D6 Supplies) Sagacity, one of the Damnic virtues, is the basis for the philosophy behind the temple at Athane. The thinkers here believe that discourse is crucial to understanding on the part of the speaker and the listener; as such, they have been in constant debate for the last forty years. Perhaps the worship became twisted over time, but what began as a desire to communicate became aneedtospeak.Today,thepriestsatAthanesharea belief that something catastrophic will happen should the debate ever cease, and the dirty steps of the central forum are littered with refuse and dozing religious philosophers. One speaker must always be on their feet, holding forth; the faithful view this as a sacred,if arduous,duty. But the priests are growing old, and fresh ideas from new thinkers rarely make their way down to Athane, so standards have begun to slip. What was once a thoughtful, if infinitely long- winded, discourse on the nature of the God‐ desses has devolved into lunatic sprawl about anything and everything – the war in Nujab, the price of malak, the secrets whispered by the Red Corridors, the selective infection patterns of the witch virus – with no direction or chair. People are welcome to stay for a while if they’re willing to hold forth on something – anything – to give the priests a chance to rest their aging bones.|

Traditionally, the Temple trains intelligence operatives – but there’s no-one to spy on in Heart that’s worth the time.It has devolved into an end‐ less cycle of practice, misdirection and back-bit‐ ing. Everyone is watching everyone else, determined to catch them in a slip-up, and the entire place is – well, paranoid isn’t the word because it’s not a delusion, but there you are.

THE TOWER|Haven, Warren|D4|• Jessamyn Duval, spiderblooded midwife and physician (D8 Blood) • The North Docks, a canal-themed bar on the ground floor (D8 Mind) • Compact Chapel of Our Glorious Lady (D8 Fortune) • The Blue Port market, airy little shopping district covered in blue tapestries (D8 Supplies) Ventrix Bring-The-River-Close was a visionary architect in the City Above. She is still a visionary architect in the City Beneath following her exile, and now she is free from petty constraints like organisational oversight, the fundamental nature of space and time or zoning laws. Ventrix had a vision of a grand unified society where everyone had a place and no-one was surplus to requirements. She would spend days in commu‐ nion with ant and bee hives, marvelling at their organisation; she studied under gnollish geoman‐ 144 Landmarks cers, worked with ostracised retro-architects from the Eastern Domain and ate corpsefruit from ancient lineages to dream of days past. She courted and mined the brains of the finest artists and thinkers that aelfir society had to offer. At the summer festival in the year of Terrible Feathers, she unveiledhercreationtothepublic:anentireredesign of Spire intended to have it function as the perfect society,withsatisfactionandcontentmentforall. This was too much for high elf society to bear. They considered themselves far better than the other races of the world, and Ventrix’s proposal threatened to undermine the strength of their dominion if the powerful ideas within ever reached the public at large. She was exiled, and though secret support from her patrons contin‐ ued, she was not allowed to set foot in the frozen halls of Amaranth ever again. Ventrix fled to the undercity,and from there to the Heart. She understood what she had to do: the minds of aelfir society could not comprehend the weight of her suggestions if they remained purely theoretical. She required an experiment; a model society, a microcosm of her ideal nation, that she could present to the council to change their minds.She began construction of the tower. Thatwasaroundfifteenyearsago,buttimemoves strangely in the Heart, and Ventrix herself feels as though she has been at work for a century or more. Her creation – simply referred to as the Tower by thosewholiveinornearit–isnearlycomplete. Thirty storeys high, the Tower takes up the entirety of the vast cave in which it was built. Each level has space for between five and ten families, and these families are responsible for different elements of sustaining the colony. A tiny copy of the Garden District takes up three floors,with res‐ idents’ beds suspended over the algae vats that feed the Tower. Tiny workshops handle the cre‐ ation of work tools, spireblack refinement and construction materials. In the open-air plazas of the mid-levels, libraries and volunteer teachers seek to educate the residents on matters of art and critical thought, and the greatest plays of the last few centuries are performed by enthusiastic (if unskilled) players.In the upper levels,Ventrix her‐ self and a wide collection of advisors consult to determine the best path forward for the colony. She rarely sleeps – instead, she tirelessly works to better the lives of those inside, and prepares for the day when she will reveal her work to the coun‐ cil in the City Above. What’s strange about the Tower is that it works. There aren’t quite enough people in there (over half of the apartments are empty) and it faces prob‐ lems from thieves and heartsblood monsters, but the residents are happy. The society ticks along just fine with Ventrix at the head, and it expands year on year. Is it due to her socialist policies? Per‐ haps. Is it due to the architectural magic woven into the bones of the building, geomantic wards and hexes rewriting the brains of those who spend more than a few days inside? Maybe. Is it due to the spiritual energy of a thousand beehives fixed in place, ordering the minds of the inhabitants into perfect co-operation? It’s hard to say. Ventrix makes no secret of the nature of the Tower, and her heart seems to be in the right place – even if her perfect society is one that requires no-one ever leave due to dissatisfaction. She is as much a prisoner of her magic as every‐ one else inside. There is no dark secret, no under‐ handed plot – just straightforward mind control in service of the perfect city. On occasion, delvers are asked to “rescue” people who’ve moved to the Tower, and they always find them unwilling to leave. Indeed, these delvers – should they spend significant time within the structure – often get involved in the community themselves and join up,forsaking everything they once were. They’re perfectly happy to do so.|When using a Haunt in the Tower, make a Endure+Occult check. 145 Landmarks FALLOUT: GREAT SOCIETY.

The streets here are filled with liquid grime, and in that grime swim wretches (p. 199) – hideous blubbery creatures that are bred by the inhabitants. Getting a leg bitten off by some half- crocodile monstrosity is tremendously funny to the folk who live in the Tunnels, and view out‐ siders thrashing about in the filth as a sort of street theatre.|This landmark will happily accept resources with the TABOO tag.|• If you go sifting through the trash and effluvia, you might be able to find something of value (D4, Any), but there are better ways to spend your time.|• Brother Colostomy, the de facto leader of the filth worshippers, is interested in building connections to nearby landmarks for trade.

GRIN STATION|Technology|D6|None Designed as an underground tourist destination by a well-meaning but totally clueless aelfir in the City Above, Grin Station is a decrepit, crumbling amusement park that has been taken apart and rebuilt several times over the last century.

It seems to be regenerating, as they keep dis‐ covering new pockets of resources: sunken cavernswithscreechingtuppenny fallsthreetimestheheightofa drow; stuttering zoetropes that project warped, titil‐ lating images onto the walls; aelfir-crafted mon‐ strosities trapped in their own filth and madness in boarded-up haunted houses; and more besides. 148 Landmarks|• Badly scratched token for the merry-go-round (D6, Haven, Niche) • Faded reel of smut from a “What the Serf Witnessed” machine (D8, Haven)|• Lyngard, an eccentric witch, requests that the delvers accompany a group of the less experienced members of her coven on an Outing.

Not that they attract many visitors – the settlement 149 Landmarks is creepy and even more sentient than its sur‐ roundings – but almost every witch who carries the virus came through here at some point in their career. Many of them owe their survival (or the disease itself) to one of the elder witches that gather in the village square after dinner, smoke pipes stuffed with hair and narcotic herbs and cackle at inscrutable running jokes that have lasted a decade or more. Each witch here is a researcher and expert on the occult, and they ven‐ erate those who have come before them with whispered mantras and solemn canticles. In the catacombs beneath Hallow, the stone gives way to meat: tense walls of muscle and fibrous tissue, and toothflower blooms that gnash and writhe. It is here where witches are buried, so that their bodies might return to the flesh of the Heart that gave them power through their lives. It is theorised that witches can’t ever really die,not in the same way that the uninfected can – they just get more and more spread out.|On occasion (especially if you upset them) a blood-witch will shift to her true form: a flickering zoetrope horror, floating through the air as if gripped by unseen hands. They have a habit of setting each other off once they get started,in a grotesque chain reaction. If this happens, the streets darken, the pave‐ ment pulses like a heartbeat, the walls become sticky with blood and the location loses the Haven domain and gains the Cursed domain.|• The lairs of the witches contain vast stores of occult ephemera (D8 to D12, Occult) but stealing it is a really bad idea.|
HANG STATION|Technology|D6|None Suspended over an artificial lake, Hang Station was designed to allow travellers on the Pulse line to view one of the aelfir’s crowning glories: a vast aquatic monster captured from the frozen seas far north, and brought to Spire for the entertain‐ ment of the populace.(Rumours that aelfir mages were siphoning magical energy from the thing’s blood and anguish should not be entertained.) There are fine bridges built between the waiting rooms, many of the floors are glass and the occa‐ sional informative plaque still survives. Now the metal hawsers supporting the bridges, tracks and platforms are rusting and unstable, and thestationrocksgentlywheneveranyonestepsonit. There’s always a chance that the cables will snap and the delvers will plummet into the depths below.

THE HARVEST BAZAAR|Cursed|"|D8"|None This bazaar, situated atop a towering, crumbling structure, is home to occult weirdos, zealots of dead gods and half-real pitchkin who ply their trade from behind brightly-coloured stalls. They offer touchstones for sale: physical manifesta‐ tions of conceptual ideas. You can buy good memories here (or sell bad ones); pick up a skill or master a musical instrument; or part-exchange your sense of decency for a working set of legs. Each of the people who runs a stall is absolutely devoted to the art of trading ephemeral concepts, because this line of work is far less efficient and 150 Landmarks profitable than trading extant goods for more of the same – or, heavens forbid, money. To put it another way: they’re into this, in kind of a weird way, so you can probably reason your way into a good deal if you can understand whatever it is an individual trader is obsessed about at present. Don’t mistake this for a friendly place, though. The bazaar drains people of their positive traits – the ability to trade them back and forth is a side- effect of the place’s hunger. The traders use other people’s traits to stay in the game, but there’s a reason that most of them are unapproachable, mean-tempered deviants: the bazaar has taken more from them than they’d like.|You can trade advances your character has in exchange for advances from other classes at a cost of D4 Mind stress for a minor advance and D6 Mind stress for a major advance. You can give up non-specific memor‐ ies or traits too, which are represented by D8 Mind stress for a minor advance and D10 for a major one. There are other uses of the bazaar’s power, such as removing fallout from your character or unlocking esoteric secrets, but the limits and costs of those are left up to the GM. RESOURCE: • A dropped memory; you’re not sure what it’s of yet (D6, Any domains that relate to the specific memory, Niche) • The gold some poor fool tried to pay with, now clogging a gutter.

HIGHRISE|Haven, Desolate|D6|Knockthrough Market, built across several floors (D8 Supplies) A great sea of rectangular towers, each at least twenty storeys tall. Between the rooftops, impro‐ vised rope bridges hang and sway in the breeze from monstrous vents. Scavengers hide in shanty villages on roof islands – dark and desperate people,eking out an existence.Death cults prom‐ ise absolution on a perfect swan-dive into the darkness below. Diseased pink-white crows caw and flock above, hungry for carrion. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets. Theravenous,howlingghostsofathousandprevious inhabitants swarm through the lower levels; they guard their abandoned, filthy apartments from thosethatwouldenterinsearchofancienttreasures. The drow inhabitants of Highrise, living lives that are all too-often cut short by starvation or hungry ghosts, have become obsessed with death. They inscribe the names of their fallen ancestors on their bodies with spidery black tat‐ toos; some add the names to their own,leading to full titles thirty or forty words in length. Smoke- wreathed shrines to dead forefathers are erected on jealously-guarded rooftops, and rival clans will take great pleasure in desecrating and eras‐ ing names written in rival territories. All bodies are thrown off the roofs into the roiling mass of ghosts below. Indeed, falling is seen as a sacred act by some. Just as some cul‐ tures venerate those fallen in battle, the drow of Highrise believe that it is right and good to fall and dash oneself apart on the broken masonry beneath. There is an art to a perfect death, and sects argue viciously over the correct way to die. 151 Landmarks FALLOUT. HARVESTED.

THE HOARD|Cursed, Occult|2 or 3|D6|None The Hoard is a library, and an impressive one at that. The shelves groan under the weight of the tomes, some of them occult or religious, some of them mundane treatises. Golden magelights hum gently in the ceiling; worn but good-quality green carpet covers the floors; and librarians putter quietly about their business, cataloguing and copying books by hand. It is a predatory building: a semi-mobile struc‐ turethatusestheunrealityoftheHearttohuntnew prey. At the centre of it is a mewling, black-eyed, swollenmaggotofathing–adragonlarvaewaiting to develop into its adult form. While it dreams it twists the world around it into the library, as it is hungry for knowledge and believes the best way to acquire it is to have people bring it books and read them aloud.

LAST ORDERS|Cursed|2 or 3|D6|The Bar (D6 Mind) Last Orders is an inn, which is strange enough in and of itself, because it usually shows up in the middle of nowhere. Still: it has beer on offer, brown paper bags of pork scratchings, little bowls of chewy dried mushrooms sprinkled with salt and a few bottles of liquor behind the bar. You could probably get a bowl of stew on a good night, too. It’s a nice place, except that it’s not. The pub is a predatory structure. Like a pitcher plant lures insects inside it to be dissolved into a nutrient-rich soup, the building eats people for nourishment. It’s not entirely clear whether it knows what it’s doing or whether it’s as passive as a carnivorous plant, but it doesn’t really matter. Anyone who has more than a couple of drinks starts to feel unwilling to leave (and why not? It’s a functional pub in the middle of a subterranean hellscape). Eventually, after having one too many and talking about their problems to the curiously sympathetic bartenders and regulars (none of whom are able to talk at length about their own lives), they’ll slope off for a piss or a nap and the building will take them. Usually the stairscollapsewhensomeonetriestouse them, and they tumble down into the basement with the other corpses. They can’t get out because their legs are broken from the fall, and slowly die in there before the pub renders themdownintofood. 153 Landmarks|It’s entirely possible to get out of Last Orders alive, but knowing about the truth of the place isn’t enough to get you through – it can still trick you.

THE MACHINES OF DUST|Cursed, Technology|D8|None At the centre of a shifting network of tunnels that stink of oil and rust and ozone is an obelisk to the Hungry Deep, nameless god of decay. The obelisk has seats, each fitted with well-used leather restraints, arranged around it in a circle. On occasion,one or more of them will be occupied by a withered, catatonic person connected to the structure via cables.The people who maintain the machines insist that these luckless souls are responsible for dreaming the Heart into being, stopping it from spreading to the City Above or for the very existence of magic in the world. The area around the structure is dusty, greasy and abundant with fat, pallid moths. The whole place is rancid with decay. Travellers will notice their equipment breaking, their hair and teeth falling out and their wounds itching and burning. The people strapped into the machines seem to be able to direct these energies somehow; pulling one out alive could let them unveil the secrets of the universe to you, or they might be completely mind-blasted into uselessness.|• Coalesced crystalline secrets of the universe, scraped off the receiver plates of the machines (D8, Occult, Beacon) • Plump little Deep Moths (D4, Desolate, Wild)|• A withered priest of the Hungry Deep recruits the delvers to escort them to the depths of the Machines of Dust (D8, Desolate/Haven) in search of nihilistic truth.

SIGHTLESS – THE TEMPLE OF GRACE|Religion, Warren|D6|• Sanctum of Our Hidden Mistress (D8 Blood, D8 Mind) • Moonsilver casket (D10 Echo) To the faithful at the temple of Sightless, grace is paramount. Worshipping the embodiment of The Moon Beneath in her form as the dark side of the moon, Lombre, they seek to exhibit grace in everything they do. Lombre is perfect, never miss‐ ing a step or saying a word out of place: they do their all to live in accordance with her example. The winding, warrenous corridors outside of the small inner sanctum are riddled with traps that maim and cut and tear, but do not kill. Those who join the temple must walk this labyrinth blindfolded, over and over, until they can step through it without triggering any of the cruel devices that are hidden in the walls and floor. The highest amongst them are far from pristine; they bear scars, missing fingers or hands and mangled feet from these traps. To them, their flesh was graceless, and Lombre blessed them by removing it so that they might understand her better. SWINEFALL|Warren|D8|None The pigs tumbled down here, slipping on spilt blood, to have their throats slit by butchers. The place is riddled with angry pig-ghosts –deranged, unable to make sense of their existence,a constant roiling storm of anguish and pain. This is a labyrinth of twisting, rusted sluices and slippery chutes, of hooks hanging from the ceiling, of the stink of shit and blood and rotting meat. The flies alone are nearly unbearable. The pig spirits have formed something of a bestial court here: travel‐ lers through Swinefall pay tribute to them with offerings of food scraps left in marked ritual sites, and usually they’re left unmolested.|• Ritual offerings amid the food left on altars (D4, Warren, Wild) • Trinkets and other lost items deep in the effluvia (D6, Warren)|• The carrion-pig (p. 181) in a nearby haven has begun calling to the ghosts of swinefall, and no-one can hear themselves think.

TRYPOGENESIS CHAMBER|Occult|D6|The Chamber (D10 Blood/Echo) (Deep Apiarist only) The Hive is a megaconsciousness beyond any‐ thing mortal minds can imagine. It dwells within the bones of the Spire, and the glyph-marked bees that fill the bodies of Deep Apiarists are simply the part of it that extrudes into the mater‐ ial realm via the Heart. The Deep Apiarists guard the Trypogenesis Chamber with their lives.Not only is it thrice-war‐ ded and largely invisible to scrying magic, but watchers armed with long-guns hide in the upper reaches of the external structure, ready to turn what seems like haphazard, curious architecture into a merciless killing-ground if necessary. Inside the curved shape of the building, through winding passageways and doorways of steel-hardwax,isthechamberitself:ahemispher‐ ical room no more than twenty feet in diameter, with at least a thousand tiny holes studding the walls and ceiling. From these holes, the Hive emerges as hundreds of glyph-marked bees. Each joins a colony under the care of a Deep Apiarist. OntheothersideoftheholesistheHive–meta‐ physically, not spatially. Every Apiarist who has attempted to send the bees back through the holes and scry through their senses has been unable to control the rush of information.Their sinuses flood with blood and honey, their brains rapidly segment 156 Landmarks out of an instinctive protective desire and they are driven mad by the scale of the thing.

WELL STATION|Technology|D6|The WELLness centre health spa. Aban‐ doned but technically functional.(D8 Mind/Blood) Built to serve the “ideal” drow community by the masters of the Vermissian, Well is remarkable in that it is all the same. Every tile is marked and chipped in the same places; every signpost displays the same gibberish letters; and there’s only one poster on every wall,advising travellers to be on the lookout for drow terrorists looking to damage the train network with occult machinations. When (if) you work your way out of the station, the area around it is similarly creepy: every street is identical. There’s the same run-down bar (Etoille’s) on every corner,and the same flowers –right down to the exact number of withered petals – grow in tattered planters on the pavement. The only thing that lets a delver know which street they’re on are the flitting forms of the hungry ghosts that popu‐ late the lower levels of the buildings, which is a less than ideal method of navigation.|• Perfect flowers (D6, Haven, Deteriorating) • Stillediblecannedfood(D6,Haven,Deteriorating) • A bottle of “WELL” water (D6, Haven, Deteriorating) • The Toy sold in the Toy Shop (D6, Haven, Deteriorating)|
THE BUNKER|Warren, Desolate (in the surrounding areas)|D6|None The 33rd Regiment penetrated deep into the Heart when they attempted to pacify it all those years ago. They were trench-fighters, their wounds still fresh from the conflict in Nujab, and so when they met with resistance they did what they knew best: they dug in and waited it out. A spiderweb network of trenches and bunkers criss-crosses the landscape and marks the furthest reach of the 33rd. Razorwire grows like vines from themuddywalls,thesoundofdistantbombingand repeater fire echoes throughout the cavern and the hands of the jealous dead reach up out of the dirt in no man’s land to bring the living into their rotten embrace. Through the ever-present smoke, the 158 Landmarks Walking Wounded (p. 199) trudge towards some long-destroyedobjective,eternallytrappedinaloop of gruesome death and painful rebirth. At the centre of it all is the Central Command structure known as The Bunker, where the leaders of the regiment did what they could to limit the wholesale slaughter of their troops by the Heart Itself. To this day, the Bunker is host to regular meetings of the 33rd: the legendary figures of the regiment meet yearly to plan and scheme, and to protect the people of the Heart on a metaphysical level that even they can barely understand.|• The first shell casing fired in the conflict (D12, Occult – when reloaded and fired does double damage against Heartsblood creatures) • Too many crumpled and destroyed dogtags (D6, Occult, Haven) • Lieutenant Kane’s heavy-bore Rifle (Kill D8, Ranged, Reload.

CAIRNMOR|Haven, Wild|D6 HAUNTS:The King’s Banquet (Mind D8,Blood D8) The King died a long time ago. He was interred in a grand barrow by his followers and then promptly forgotten as the tribe was wiped out by disease. The great tree above the barrow fell, tearing open the entrance to the chamber and splitting apart, dripping intoxicating golden sap onto the body of the King. He was restored to life (kind of) and is convinced that he is in his own personal afterlife. He spends his days col‐ lecting and drinking the plentiful sap and telling tales of his glories to his assembled court, who are also all dead.|• The tree sap makes for an excellent, if sticky, booze (D8 for a bottle), but the King doesn’t appreciate people stealing from the afterlife and his attendants are quicker than they look.|
GHASTLING PLAIN|Desolate|D6|Communal longhut with a roaring fire and excellent “seafood” (D8 Blood, D8 Mind) The ceiling here is a smouldering, ever-burning mass of something: cinders twinkle in the depths and embers tumble down to form a sea of ash, shifting like water. There are people, here and there, who crave the raw nothingness of the place. They live quiet lives in houses kept out of the ash on stilts and fish for the pallid, eyeless lizards and squidlike creatures that scud through the detritus beneath them. Some build platforms out of taut ropes and creaking metal spider-legs that can move through the ash, but the majority of them travel on lightweight skiffs. The squid of ghastling plain are especially prized for their “ink” sacs. Evolved to work in air, rather than water, they issue a billowing cloud of night-black, abrasive grit that confuses predat‐ ors and allows them to escape confrontation.|• Ink-dust harvested from land-squid (D8, Desolate, Occult, Volatile) • A vaguely fishlike animal with too many eyes (D4, Desolate, Wild) • Bleached bones the size of a full-grown drow, for construction purposes (D6,Desolate,Awkward) 159 Landmarks|• There is something far larger than squid in the ash-sea, and it has been gnawing on the stilts of people’s homes. The mayor of Ghastling Plain, an eccentric and barely-cogent drow known as Mishel Legrand, asks you (in a roundabout way) to hunt it down (D6, Desolate; the creature could presumably be harvested as well). • Sink-holes have been opening in the ash-sea, dragging animals and fishermen down to somewhere lower. A wizened mage by the name of Exquisite believes that they are an expression of the Drowned Queen’s majesty, and offers to fund an expedition down one (D12, Haven, Occult) on the express understanding that she is allowed to come along for the ride.|
THE MAW|Cursed, Desolate|D6; D8 in the Maw itself|None Tents and lean-tos surround this place. Everything is falling apart, and the handful of people you spy huddling behind fallen columns or whispering into holes in the ground seem broken, decrepit and wasted-away. These are fol‐ lowers of the Hungry Deep: the nameless god of decay that resides inside the Heart and rewards sacrifices with an extended life (albeit a strange and dark one). They have given all they can to the Deep, and spend their remaining lives working out how to give more. In the middle of the community is a grand maw, brutalist and angular, that accepts their offerings; a huge obsidian obelisk protrudes from the centre.The obelisk is uncomfortably,hideously real – every object, life or love sacrificed to it feeds and solidifies it in the minds of those around it. It is hard to look away and impossible not to focus on; in comparison, the rest of the world around it seems vague and indistinct. The chamber around the obelisk descends into the earth, and it is here that nihilistic cultists will venture down sharp staircases in search of ecstatic communion with the Hungry Deep. Any delver worth their spireblack will realise that the maw is a direct, if dangerous, route to the Heart Itself.|Any resources or equipment found here will have the DETERIORATING or VOLATILE tags.|• The delvers acquire something so utterly dangerous that the only safe course of action is to hurl it into the Maw, stripping it of its quintessence. • A beloved NPC wanders down here, bewitched by whispers of oblivion, and is now leading a cult of blind, toothless madmen on one-way pilgrimages down the maw.

Built by the gnolls who live there using mechanoccultist techniques, it was the crown jewel of the resistance that fights against the encroaching aelfir armies. The streets, a pre‐ cisely-ordered series of concentric circles, were lined with roses and orchids grown from a living silicate construct which caught the dying light of the sun each night and washed the neighbour‐ hood in scintillating colours. At the centre, the 161 Landmarks Institute of Celestial Ontology made inroads into the nature of space and time that rivalled the uni‐ versities of Al’Marah in the south. It was a beautiful place to live and work – until an attempt to siphon power from the Source (p. 174) to power miracles resulted in the Institute, and the surrounding streets, translocating wholesale into the depths of the Heart. Chief Ontologist Yahudz Harvestlight has taken informal control of the settlement and opened trade with nearby landmarks, but this deep in the Heart there are few sane people to do business with. He is of the belief that the Heart is a sort of cosmic drain that all things lost in transit must pass through,and he might even be correct. He’s doing his best to view the transportation as a blessing that allows him, and his associates, to better understand the nature of the universe – a point of view that’s not shared by many of the other inhabitants. After travelling to meet the wise-women of Hallow a year ago, Harvestlight has contracted the witch virus (although he’d never admit it). He maintains a stable of cat and cat-like familiars who siphon off the arcane stress that is put on his system by maintaining the wards that keep the Plaza relatively safe. At his behest, the glass flowers still grow, but they do so in curious paths and hang heavy with translucent fruit. They also grow in thorny patterns to keep out intruders, but he’ll part them if he reckons a visitor might have something interesting to trade or share – especially some decent kafee.|• Silicate flower (D8, Haven, Fragile) • Mechanoccultist spare parts (D6, Technology, Occult)|

In Soufri, the smoke can flood the streets without warning. In Soufri, the trees are dead and the flagstones cracked.Even compared to the rest of the Heart, Soufri is a terrible place; yet people choose to live there. The Goddess, the Moon Beneath in her infinite splendour, speaks truth. She says that of all her virtues, tenacity is the most important. To suffer and endure, espe‐ cially to suffer without an ulterior motive in mind, is to honour her. At least, this is what the inhabitants of Soufri believe. A few dozen die-hard adherents to the Damnic faith have set up shop here, where the sulphurous smoke clogs their lungs and they suck at old pipes for water, to better serve her. They are, universally, horrible.

TERMINUS|Technology|D6|None The trains have to stop somewhere. In Terminus, one of the fabled Nexus Devices of the Vermis‐ sian Network, sits a great central turntable on which trains would enter and rotate to face their next line. The chamber is dotted with tunnel entrances that go all the way to the top of the 162 Landmarks domed ceiling – the turntable can be rotated not just right and left, but up, down and strangewise. The Vermissian was not just technological in nature. To fulfil the unique needs of creating a mostly vertical train network, the designers had to resort to occult means to achieve their goals. It is theorised that the lines formed a complex arcane glyph through the Cities Above and Beneath, and the trains would trace the shape of it with their movements to ensure its survival – the magic was, it was proposed, self-sustaining. The network collapsed, of course, leaving the warding glyph unscored and the magic in the walls unrestrained and wild. But the Nexus Devices, which are powered by great machines that siphon energy from the Heart Itself, con‐ tinue to function as though trains were coming through them every hour. They constantly rotate and spin in unfathomably complex patterns. Thoughhardtonavigateandevenhardertopre‐ dict,Terminuscan–intheory–allowaccesstoany part of the Vermissian, even the lost Harvest Line or the metaphysically-locked Crescent-of-the- Morning station.

WARDSTONE NASONOV|Occult|D4|None This is the end of the unstable dominion of the Deep Apiarists. This single stone, eight feet tall and wedged into soft earth, is their greatest achievement to date. Around it, the mad unreal‐ ity of the Heart falls away, and there is calm in a radius of around ten feet. Bees swarm around it, tracing out warding glyphs with complex movements, but before long each bee that is stationed here dies. There is very little food to go around, and the stress of main‐ taining the magic is more than their little bodies can handle. The ground is covered with their bodies, the glyphs dulled and incomprehensible. The Deep Apiarists understand sacrifice, as do their passengers, but it is with grim acceptance that skilled members of the sect make a pilgrim‐ age to Nasonov and deposit a portion of their swarm each year. It is Nasonov, they claim, that keeps the Heart at bay; it is Nasonov that leaves the surface world intact and confines the conflict between chaos and stasis to the City Beneath. It is a sacrifice they are willing to make.|• Rock chippings from the wardstone (D8, Occult, Taboo,Beacon) • Sickly bees (D4, Occult, Mobile)|• Sikalayon Sova, a dying Deep Apiarist, begs you to take his body to Nasonov so his last act can be to reinforce the wards.

As the world starts to crumble around you even more than usual, you’re worried that he might be right. 163 Landmarks|
THE ROOM|Warren|Rogue|D4|None. The Room copies itself. It’s an innocuous enough place: a bedsit, by the looks of it, with a few books on the shelf, some art on the walls, a simple kit‐ chen around a stove and a chimney in one corner. But leave one of the doors (there’s one external, one internal) and you’ll walk into a copy of the room, and from that into another copy and so on. This isn’t a trick of the mind – the room exists in physical space and so do you. There’s just hun‐ dreds of copies, all joined together. The items in each room (again, identical) are skewed and off-centre of reality. The books refer‐ ence events that haven’t happened and are writ‐ ten by authors no-one has heard of.The art shows an advertisement for a dated-looking stage play that was never performed. The food is dried meat from an unrecognisable animal, hard cheese tinged a strange red, and pear-like fruit of an unknown origin. (You can eat it, as long as it’s not rotted.) People occasionally ransack or occupy the rooms, but they have no way of repairing themselves, so they stay different. The items themselves appear to be like seeds for the room: if taken away, they’ll slowly change the areas they’re placed in into a copy of the room. The room also affects areas by proximity, changing adjoining chambers into itself. The arrival of The Room in a community is heralded with fear and suspicion, and artefacts stolen from them are viewed as dangerous, infec‐ ted items to be shunned. However, some people (especially the Vermissian Sages) will pay hand‐ somely for intact copies of the books and posters. They say that there are minute differences between them that are somehow vitally import‐ ant. All too often someone brings in a stolen bed‐ sheet – then they wake up one day and their bedroom will have become a copy of The Room. It’ll spread from there unless it's burned out. There are, of course, two sects who have devoted their lives to investigating The Room.One believes it is the handiwork of a kindly god and want to spread thedivineplanasbesttheycan;theotherbelievesThe Room is the work of a wicked devil and must all be burnedbeforeittakesoverthewholeworld. 164 Landmarks FALLOUT.

A nameless wizard – one of the ancient Sorcerer-Kings who conjured demon-towersfromthenakedearthintheBlastedAgeoftheHomeNations – postulated that, just as bees sup nectar from flowers, there must be an insect that can plunge its proboscis in the ear of a dreamer and siphon off its sweetness. Perhaps, he thought, that’s how ideas spread with suchspeedthroughapopulace!Thisdoesn’texactlymakesense,but the wizard was so deep in a dozen demonic bargains that rhyme hadbeguntoreplacereasoninhisshatteredpalaceofamind. There are fragments of his various ideas scattered throughout the world, and several of those are in the Heart,where the walls between real and unreal are thin indeed. Papilious is one such place: an extra-dimen‐ sional fracture, accessed by encouraging a particu‐ lartypeofmothtogentlyprobeyourearinsearch of delicious secrets, then following it as it flits around the City Beneath. Eventually, though you will not notice the change, you will be standinginoneofthemanydoorwaysto Papilious:thehomeofthemoth-keep‐ ers and the guardians of their lore books. Upon first impressions, Papilious seems like an idyllic place. Moths, their bodies loaded with insubstantial pollen taken from the consciousnesses of those nearby, 166 Landmarks are brushed with soft-bristled tools.Once loosened,the pollen is carefully spread inside the pages of blank books, where it miraculously begins to take the shape of words, pictures and formulae incomprehensible to all but the most learned scholars. Several of the greatest minds of the City Above have visited Papilious in search of wisdom, and they have found it. The keepers sell spare dust from the moths as a mind-sharpening drug, and invest the takings into magical wards and defences to keep Papilious safe. But as you explore, the library will shift and twist into something else: there are two Papiliouses, each stored within the other. Towering archives become tumbledown wretched dens where desperate people sell access to the darkest recesses of their brains; benevolent librarians become monstrous, cruel priests devoted to har‐ vesting secrets and bearing the eggs of their masters on their exposed necks; and the pursuit of wisdom is inverted into a rapacious desire for forbidden, harmful knowledge. Spymasters and dark magicians buy (or steal) secrets from the cultish guardians, and more than one delver has met their end here in a mad quest for enlightenment. Opening the wrong door in the benevolent version will lead you to the malevolent one, and vice versa – but neither set of inhabitants gives any credence to the ridiculous theory that an entire inverted version of their own reality sits on the other side of a doorway or down a winding corridor.

In the back rooms of bars where secrets are sold, it is whispered that there is a fractured mirror image of the City Above hiding deep in the bowels of the Heart. This Unspire is said to be a strange and pale imitation of the original; the people there are not quite real, but they occasionally venture through to the Heart (which both cities share) in search of meaning. Should a delver find Vanishing Point, the mid‐ point between the two places, they can venture into this paper-thin Spire (after passing their doppleganger,who had the same idea at the same time) and explore – perhaps even bringing back uncanny relics of the place. The Vermissian Sages have a vested interest in Unspire: they claim that the Heart Itself was never pierced there, and so the train network was not pitched into impossible chaos.|
THE FOREST|Wild|Fracture|D8|None Long ago, people feared the night and hunted beasts with simple weapons, they believed in a different kind of heaven that was located deep beneath the earth. When you died and your bones shook off the heavy flesh that tied them to the world,andyourspiritwormeditswaythroughrock and dirt and sand,you would awaken in the Forest. There you would hunt forever and you would never go hungry, because if you did, something bigger than you would take advantage of your weak‐ ness and eat you. Few believe this any more,save for asparkinthemindsofprimitivecreatures–butstill the Forest waits, hibernating, until the cities of the worldcollapseanditreturnstoitstruepower. The Forest is too large. The trees are massive, and tower over those who wander here. The branches and leaves make a thick canopy over‐ head, allowing only sickly, weak rays of light. Deer that are easily ten foot to the shoulder pick their way through the tangled web of roots that covers the ground; hares the size of dogs skitter through the undergrowth; and the predators, huge rangy beasts with matted fur and jagged teeth, are never far away from the edge of your vision. On occasion you might find another person, ancient and powerful, their bodies and minds scarred from years of hunting with only the weapons they can make themselves. None speak modern languages; some don’t speak at all. These are the last vestiges of the people who dreamed this vast,indifferent heaven wreathed in perpetual twilight into being, and they are powerful indeed. Perhaps beneath the Forest there is yet another heaven where the beasts are larger still, the meat more filling, the stars more distant. No one’s found it and come back yet.

THE GRAIL ROAD|Desolate, Religion|Fracture|D6|None The humans from the east believe that upon their death,they will begin a journey down a long road of packed earth and cracked stone flanked by an end‐ less, barren plain. The more important and right‐ eous they were in life, the more vital and powerful they are here. Heroes of the Kingdom, the royal wanderer-nobles who battle the wild creatures of their lands, are hyper-real and defined; but the peasantswhotoilundertheminthefieldsaresemi- ephemeral, vague sketches of their former selves. Grave goods are carried across, too; kings are resplendent in velvet robes and bear ceremonial blades, but most of the people you’ll see are naked aside from the cloth in which they were wrapped when they were buried in the earth. Everyoneknowsthatascensionwaitsattheendof theroad.Shouldatravellerreachit,theywillbecome a god in their pantheon – indeed, every human god was once a mortal who has reached the end of their journey.

The vast majority of people give up on their journey, whether permanently or temporarily, and eke out an existence from what little they can findorstealfromothersontheroad. It is only the heroes that can hope to reach the end of the road and ascend – or a very clever peasant who can scheme and rob their way through the afterlife, amassing enough power and followers to complete the journey despite starting off at a distinct disadvantage.|• Grave goods from a fallen noble (D8, Desolate, Religion)|
THE GREY|Desolate|Fracture|D4|None Between the lands of the living and the lands of the dead, the Grey persists. A pale and shadowy replica‐ tion of the real world, the Grey is a 169 Landmarks catch-all purgatory for the souls of the recently departed. They traipse back and forth in a poor imitation of their routines when they were alive, or huddle scared and shivering in ephemeral doorways once the reality of their deaths set in. There are no gods here,no power blocs,no flora or fauna other than the pallid remnants of the living – and even they are only here temporarily. Onoccasion,deadwalkers(p.32)orothertravellers with the knack of stepping sideways use the Grey as a means of circumventing obstacles in the material realm: a well-guarded outpost becomes an abandoned, tumbledown tower, and can easily be walked past without incident. The Grey is something of a hub location for afterlives; it is theorised that each one can be accessed through some esoteric route within this liminal realm. It is only within the boundaries of the Heart, where the walls between worlds are thin and permeable, that the living can hope to enter the lands of the dead and return intact. SPECIALRULES: ThelongeronestaysintheGrey, the more their body is stripped away from their soul. This process doesn’t hurt – quite the opposite, in fact. The flesh is struck with an overwhelming numbness, and stimuli become dulled and indistinct as the skin turns sallow- grey and the eyes rheumy.In game terms,visit‐ ing the Grey for a single situation is survivable, but each additional situation spent there requires a character to pass an Endure+Desol‐ ate roll or suffer D6 stress to Blood.

As the shadow creeps across the moon, it brings the Dark City with it. The buildings crawl and unfurl to fill the space, slotting together to form insane pathways, stairs to nowhere and doors that open onto sheer drops into nothing‐ ness. The Dark City is crawling with souls, but most of them will keep out of the way of delvers – to them, living people shine like beacons, and it hurts to be around them for too long. They speak nigh-constantly in a low whisper of patched-to‐ gether fragments of language that they use to exchange secrets and issue threats, each trying to outdo the others and get out of the Dark City for good. At the edges of the light, where the Moon Garden meets the Dark City and the cracked obsidian gives way to silver grass and soft moon‐ light, a crowd of shades cluster at the border and watch the meandering of the blessed souls in the Garden with night-black eyes.

THE MOON GARDEN|Haven, Religion|Fracture|D4|None. However, each day you spend here, remove D4 Blood and Mind stress. Folk who worship the moon goddess and live good lives are permitted to stay here for eternity.Located on the light side of the moon,the Moon Garden is a shifting monochrome wonder‐ land: great towers of lunar rock spiral beautifully into the starry sky, silver-leaved ivory-white trees dot the landscape and acres of bushes ripe with fruit stretch off over the horizon. At the centre of thegarden(whichmovesaccordingtohowmuchof the moon is currently lit by the sun) sits Limye, the dark elf goddess of community and tenacity. She sings sweetly to her followers to calm them and bring sweet release to their belaboured spirits. It is a calm place – too calm, some Deadwalkers think, as just walking into the place dulls the mind and fills one’s head with soporific thoughts of silver and moonlight. But there is something peaceful in oblivion; in having one’s soul strung up with moonsilver and never feeling worry or fear ever again. The dead who spend eternity here are placid, gentle souls. Some tend to the gardens, even though they don’t need to, and some pick out patterns in the stars and planets that dance overhead. On occasion they’ll try to write some music or paint, but noth‐ ing complex seems to last here, and they grow forgetful before giving up entirely.

THE PALACE MULTIFACETED|Religion, Occult|Fracture|D8|Anything your heart desires (D12, all Resistances. All resources are counted as one dice size lower at this haunt) The Incarnadine sect – and by extension, their cousins the Azurites in the City Above – believe that heaven is real and that you can buy your way in.Indeed,the only method of entry is to purchase access through donating money, goods and time to the temple in your name. Each “gift” is added to your official account, and the more you’ve given by the time of your death, the grander and more lux‐ urious your quarters will be. The Palace Multifaceted feels like a cross between a high-end brothel and a theme park. There is no end to the luxury on offer here (for the right price) and the features are only limited by the imaginations and bank balances of the residents. A modest afterlife might amount to a three-bed‐ room apartment, nice curtains, all the malak you can stand to take and access to a delightful shared garden; but a high priest’s reward could be a man‐ sion wrought from floating iron that sings with the wind, a fountain that sprays beautiful artwork made from water in prismatic bursts and a feast‐ ing table that is always full of delicious food and drink.These places are stitched together with eph‐ emeral streets and corridors, and it’s considered a boon to get into a good part of heaven rather than slumming it with the proles in the lower levels.

THE SLUMBERING DEPTHS|Religion, Wild|Fracture|D6|None The Solar Pantheon (the four gods of seasons and weather that the aelfir worship almost exclusively) teaches of oblivion and reincarn‐ ation after death, with the believer’s soul-stuff being reformed anew in the deep, mystical oceans far to the north. It swims like a shoal of fish through the supernal sea, looking for a new-born to investitselfin. 173 Landmarks 174 On the ocean’s bed, there are great forests of kelp that tower hundreds of feet into the air and stain the light orange-green with their translucent leaves. Within are the trapped souls of tens of thousands of high elves,their spectral skin a pallid hue, that fitfully sleep and writhe against their restraints. These are the Slumbering Depths. The aelfir here are dreaming. They are dreaming of the lives of perfect elegance and beauty they will leadonthesurface. They dream of betrayals and love; of sumptuous wines, of quick and sure narcotics, of art that brings them to tears, of the fierce pain of birth. The richer and more beautiful their life, the longer they will dream; and as they dream, they drown, and their lungs flood with burning saltwater. At the culmina‐ tion of their dream, as they experience their own death,their form bursts into light and glittering fish spiral out to rush towards the surface. They will not remembertheirdreamsoncetheyareborn,exceptin fragmentaryglimpsesthatarehardtodiscern. In this way, the aelfir live their afterlives back‐ wards. They are not rewarded for good or moral behaviour whilst they are alive,but rather earn an ideal life through centuries of celestial torment.

THE SOURCE|Occult, Technology|Fracture|D8|None Al’Marah, the capital city of the southern gnollish desert kingdom, has no state religion. The gov‐ ernment there dictates that the souls of all people who die within sight of the central ziggurat of Al’Marah are absorbed into the Source: a corus‐ cating realm of energy from which djinns and ifrits are drawn to power gnollish machinery. They know this to be a scientific fact because spe‐ cially-shielded teams have braved the depths of the ziggurat, found heaven and reported back on it with first-hand eyewitness accounts. It is a great labyrinth with corridors easily ten times the height of a gnoll and strange symbols etched into the walls in electrum and gold. On occasion, the symbols will flare – a warning, per‐ haps – and great storms of lightning will spiral down the corridor at unimaginable speed. Until the seventh exploration team learned the trick of interpreting the sigils, this was the most common cause of death when in the Source. Upon closer inspection, the symbols are all linked; each is con‐ nected to the other with gleaming wire, and the insane complexity of the circuitry within is illus‐ trative of the complexity of the labyrinth itself. Exploration team 23 encountered –according to the expedition’s only survivor –a metallic construct of some kind. After they took samples of the elec‐ trum wiring in the walls,a formless spasm of whip‐ pingsteelhawsersandscrapingclawsassaultedthe unarmed and unarmoured team, ripping all but one to shreds within minutes. It proceeded to repair the damage caused to the circuitry. You might find an exploration team (p. 188) down here. Since the events of Expedition 23, they carry weapons now and are unlikely to welcome the presence of intruders, but if they’re in a tight spot they might need the help of a team of enter‐ prising delvers.
