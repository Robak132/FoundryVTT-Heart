ANGEL|They are red and terrible and mighty. They bring with them waking dreams of chaos and unmaking, a screeching, scraping song of rust and ashes. The angels of the Heart, as they are known by the inhabitants of the place, are thankfully rare. When the cosmic intelligence at the center of the City Beneath needs something done quickly and without subtlety, it will create one and dispatch it with a specific mission: the destruction of a haven that’s encroaching on valuable resources, avenging the death of a beloved creature, reclaiming something that’s been taken, and so on. As they enter an area, it shifts into an unreal landscape. Walls pulse and seep interstitial fluid, the sound of grinding teeth drowns out all rational thought, and eyes blossom on every available surface.|Crimsonian, Vulperine, Theolosian (anyone who witnesses an angel knows its name instinctively; indeed,they are unable to forget it)|A noise like tearing meat and screaming gristle; Wet red streamers coalescing and spiralling into the shape of an elongated humanoid; An immobile statue of bone with floating masks that shimmer and reform as it speaks.|Each angel is created to fulfil a specific objective, and can’t understand things that aren’t its objective.

AUTOMATON OF BURDEN|Though these mechanical creatures come in many varieties, the most common design is a headless four-legged pack animal. By using material scavenged from the broken alternate realities of the Vermissian (and from even weirder machines buried deeper beneath the earth), the creators of these devices can imbue them with basic intelligence via occult rituals. Some have the mind of a horse or ox bound into them, but such beasts are hard to come by in the Heart. Instead, the designers must rely on substitutes: the combined intelligences of twenty pigeons, perhaps, or one of the carrion-swine that plague the settlements of the City Beneath. These automatons follow their owners and carry their effects, so they’re popular with the reclaimers who dig into the depths of the Vermissian in search of treasure or sellable junk. Generally, you’ll see them attached to their master via a chain or rope, but some can detect sigils stamped into the ground: by carving a unique symbol into the base of their staff, a reclaimer can mark a path for their automaton as they walk along. Some older traders ride them, sitting cross-legged on their backs while surrounded by black candles, tapping ahead of the beast with a stick so it can follow the noise. Occasionally, automatons will wander away from their owner, or their owner will die, leaving them masterless. These are highly-prized treasures, and rumors of ramshackle constructs shuddering through the city laden with lost riches are popular in taverns and drug-dens all throughout the Heart.|Bessie, Vyssos 3-X, Wrench|Thrice-repaired, with legs of different lengths and wooden side-panelling; Housing a portable shrine to the Moon Beneath and trailing incense; Stolen and joy- ridden by wretched pitchkin.|To follow their master however they’ve been programmed to do so, and to avoid harm.|Standard|10|0, unless their owner has reinforced them to 1 or 2.|Frantic animal intelligence (D6, Occult); Spare parts (D8, Technology).|Spindly legs (Kill D4).|If you acquire an Automaton of Burden, it functions as a (Delve D6) item.|Technology
BLOODED|The Heart changes people mentally and physically. The blurring world in the City Beneath smears the bodies and souls of the inhabitants into curious patterns. Worming its way into their blood, it passes its influence on to their offspring, and children born several generations deep can be strange indeed. Some have developed new sense organs: black orb-like eyes that can sense the Heart’s touch, or bristling hairs that taste the wind pricking up from their forearms. Some are born with birthmarks that warp and change into script over the course of their lives; some have fingernails of organic glass or spiraling horns of bone curling from their brow. Stranger still, the Heart blurs the lines between flesh and not-flesh, between the individual and the place, and surgical implantation is possible in ways unthought of in the surface world. Body parts such as fingers, eyes, and occasionally whole limbs can be grafted onto a donor and retain function (the acceptance rate is surprisingly high). Animal body parts can be used too, and depending on the level of hearts-blood in the individual, even inorganic materials such as stone, repurposed machinery, or crystal can be worked into someone’s body and given sensitivity if not function. Those with implants who travel to the surface world find that their bodies start to reject them when free of the Heart’s influence. The deeper one travels into the Heart, the more blooded people one will find. Many of them regard delvers as invaders blundering into a world they’re not entitled to in order to plunder its secrets, and not without reason. It was those changed by the Heart who bore the brunt of the original expedition of the 33rd, the regiment that would become the Hounds.|Normal people names, perhaps about fifty years out of date: Versellian, Xandrix, Sewain, Brimner|Growing rows of teeth inside their mouth that make it difficult to speak; Listening to the singing crystals implanted in their chest and shoulders; Farming mushrooms and smoking clove cigarettes brought down by travellers.|To live in the Heart in peace, and not get killed thanks to some clueless delver unleashing hell.|Standard|6|0 for most, but those devoted to protecting the Heart and who are prepared for a fight have Protection 2|Jewellery, keepsakes and valuables (D6).Their bodies,or body parts,can be sold as medical curiosities, but most havens in the Heart frown on this.|Knife, club or poor-quality sword (D6); whatever ranged weapons they could scare up (D8, Ranged, One-Shot)|""|Wild, Cursed
BURNT-OUT OCCULTIST|The rush of power can leave you wanting more; sorcery can certainly be an easy route to getting what you want, but the bristling touch of other realities on the mind can intoxicate and bewitch the caster. Driven mad by want and out of other options,these desperate mages will form fractious gangs and rob or kill vulnerable travellers in search of scraps of magical power – or whatever resonance they can wring out of the poor individual’s blood. The real danger is that one of these wretches will get their hands on a serviceable book of demonology. They’re just smart enough to cast the spells and just tweaked-out enough to not take any of the proper precautions. More than one haven has been unmade in a scintillating blur when some reckless occultist created an incursion, willingly or not. The Hounds have a vested interest in stopping it from happening again.|Griz, Swent, Nox.|Wearing a cracked porcelain mask, the last vestige of their life of luxury in the City Above; Going through the bins outside a church looking for something with a vague hint of power; Trailing a Junk Mage, their hands outstretched, begging for angel feathers or automaton dreams.|To learn new spells; to gather occult resources and huff them to cast magic; to get high, and forget their troubles for a bit.|Standard|6|0|Almost-useless scraps of occult energy (D4, Occult)|Black market black magic (Kill D8,Brutal,Ranged.This can inflict Blood or Mind stress on the target; the GM chooses.)|If a Burnt-Out Occultist inflicts 7 or more stress on a single roll, they are taken out of action by the magical feedback.|Occult
BUTCHER|These were once desperate people who, despite the warning songs and folk tales, ate the forbidden flesh that grows in secret places, making wet pulsing walls and beckoning with lipless mouths. Over time, it turned them into horrendous creatures of blight and bone. They are easily twice the height of a person, with rangy,pallidlimbsthatgivethemtremendousspeed and strength.

CARRION-PIG|Pigs eat whatever rubbish they can find, so they’re a common pest in havens; they’ll scrub through waste piles and gutters looking for delicious morsels until someone chases them away. But their appetite is nothing compared to the carrion- pig: an enormous beast, easily the size of a horse and hugely fat, that eats absolutely anything organic you throw near its mouth. Carrion-pigs are popular methods of waste disposal in the Heart. Catch one (if you’re brave enough), lock it in a cellar, throw anything vaguely edible down there, and it’ll gobble it up in seconds. Put a drain underneath and sluice it out once in a while, and you’ve got some foul-smelling fertilizer you can spread over whatever you’ve managed to grow. Is it cruel to do this? Absolutely. It’s a bastard thing to do, and in havens where they’re used, most inhabitants try not to think about it. What’s more, carrion-pigs’ size is only limited by their age and how much they get to eat, so those that have been kept for years (or even decades) slowly grow to fit the shape of wherever they’re imprisoned. But they never get sick (they’re medical marvels), can survive for months off their own reserves of fat, and are useful for disposing of bodies should the Hounds come round asking about what happened to the last bunch of delvers who came through the town and mysteriously disappeared. They grow their largest in captivity, but wild ones are still pretty huge – easily enough to threaten an unsuspecting delver should they come across one. The bigger problem is when mating season rolls around. Picking up the scent of huge and fecund females trapped underneath havens, males will gather on nearby outcroppings of rock and bellow a deep-throated call that makes windows shake. Should the female carrion-pig hear this, she’ll thrash around against the confines of her prison and – if it’s not well-built enough – destroy it, smash apart a good section of the haven with it, and romp off in search of her lover-to-be.|Owners tend not to name carrion-pigs because they don’t want to empathize with them.|Smashing through a nearby wall; Squealing so loud you think your eardrums are going to burst; Hungrily feasting on the corpse of their owner.|To eat, mate and, if it’s got time, gain revenge on its owners.|Risky, if they’re in heat; Standard otherwise.|15|5|Too much stinking pig fat (D8, Heavy).|Crushing body and champing jaws (Kill D8, Brutal).|""|Haven, Wild.
DRUID LEGBREAKER|The druid-gangs of Redcap Grove enforce their will over the surrounding area (and several neighbourhoods of Derelictus) with squads of shapeshifting druids. More than one headstrong tough has shot a rival on their turf only to have them, and all their mates, twist their bodies into nightmarish needle-toothed forms and attack.|Rhoz, Thorne, Pitch|Picking their teeth with a night- black thorn; Eyes that flick between different pupil types every time they blink; Smoking incense rolled into a cigarette.|To protect the interests of their High Druid masters.|Standard|8|1|Ritual gewgaws and tchotchkes made of mushrooms and animal bones (D6, Wild).|Sickles, picks and mushroom- hooks (Damage D6).||Wild.
FALSE HALLOW|Messiahs are a common sight in the Heart. Most weeks,some wide-eyed pilgrim will stumble out of Derelictus and into the winding tunnels of the City Beneath in search of the truth denied to them in the surface world. Shouting of a coming doom, or muttering madly to themselves about salvation, most of them die within a few weeks of entering the City Beneath. Most commonly they’ll be convinced they’re reincarnated Hallows (saints) of Our Glorious Lady or some other aspect of the moon, but martyrs for the Solar Pantheon or the Charnel Death-cult aren’t unheard of. But not all of them die. Some are charismatic, or brutal enough to be feared, and draw cults around themselves with petty trickery and promises of power in the afterlife. Some never believed in the first place, and are con-artists playing a dangerous game. With reality being what it is in the Heart, those skilled or lucky enough to gather a following can leech off the faith of those devoted to them, and begin to spontaneously generate powers that are indistinguishable from miracles. They can heal the sick, send poxes on their enemies and strike down the wicked with a single mighty blow. The Church of the Moon Beneath has a vested interest in removing False Hallows from power; they don’t like the competition, and a lot of the behaviour of these living bandit-saints could be construed as heretical. Similarly, temples from the City Above will dispatch agents to silence False Hallows before their schemes gain momentum. It took the efforts of a joint force of Solar Pantheon paladins and specially-warded delvers to locate and destroy the heretical Church of the New Sun in the year of Crimson Ravens.|Vasselin, Solipsus, Autumn-Storms-Curdle-the-Sky-and-We-Are-Found-Wanting.|Carried on a palanquin by four weeping devotees; Floating above the ground, their cloak caught in a wind that isn’t blowing; Casually walking through a hail of fire without a scratch.|To foster a cult around them and grow in power; this might be for pious or selfish reasons, but it’s hard to tell the difference.|Dangerous|8|3|Unhallowed relics (D10, Occult)|Simple work tools or repurposed ritual items (Kill D10 in their hands, Kill D6 for anyone else).|False Hallows will often be surrounded by a cult of some kind; use the Signal-Box Cultist to represent them, but exchange the Technology domain for Religion.|Religion, Occult
FEMALE HARPY|Each male harpy is a magpie-like corvid about the size of a housecat, and they like to take sharp and shiny things from people. They tie the sharp things they take onto their beaks and talons to augment their dive-bombing method of catching prey. Older harpies have a wide array of knives, spear points, bayonets and cutlery attached to their pointed white beaks, and bent carpentry nails, fishing hooks and climbing pitons bound to their feet. One swooping from a cave roof can easily puncture the armour of an incautious delver. Harpies will gladly work in teams to dive-bomb a lone wanderer, quickly rendering them incapable of proper retaliation through pain and blood-loss. The shit-caked birds cackle and caw at their prey as it dies, and often imitate the sound of its death throes, as they are capable (and apparently cruel) mimics. They bring the shiny things back to their bowers: mating sites intended to attract the attention of a female. To a harpy, “shiny” seems to mean occult resonance – they have an instinctive attraction towards items that are used to augment magical spells. Necklaces bearing wicked sigils, black-wax candles and two-headed goat placenta have all been stolen from travellers and arranged around the harpy’s mating site in curious patterns. Once the harpy has gathered enough shiny things, it will kill smaller creatures – rats, mice, feral piglets, pitchkin – and drag their corpses back to its bower where it will mark summoning sigils in their blood on the stone floor. Then, working on instinct alone, the harpy will caw out a mating call using fragments of language that it does not understand, stolen from the throats of the dying. This draws the attention of a female. The female harpy is a different beast: a humanoid the height of a drow, with great wings where its hands would be, but no less filthy or callous than the male. The bowers act as summoning circles to draw them forth from whatever hellish dimensiontheydwellin.Theyemergethrougharift in the blood-soaked floor and mate with the male (an act which generally results in his death). Fromthere,theywillscreechforthandexperience the joys that the Heart has to offer: fresh prey, the terror on the faces of their victims, the feeling of flightaftereonsofconfinementintheirgrimdimension.

Only more death and fear can keep them in the CityBeneath,orelsetheywillcrumbletodustastheir spiritsaredraggedbacktotheirotherworldlyprison. The female harpy will aim to slaughter her way to a haven, kill whoever she can inside and lay as many eggs as possible before her soul is claimed.

FERAL PSYCHOPOMP|The gaps between worlds are thin in the Heart, and it is possible to break into (or out of) heaven and hell using rituals performed at specific sites. Were everything working as intended, these realms would be entirely separate from the City Beneath – but the energy of the Heart has burrowed into other dimensions and they have begun to leak through, as have the beings who live within them. Many faiths tell of creatures, collectively known as psychopomps, who ferry the souls of the dead to the afterlife. Curious or opportunistic psychopomps will sometimes leave their respective afterlives and explore the curious terrain of the Heart. Severed from the divine intelligences that govern them, these creatures turn animalistic and desperate when trapped in the wrong reality. Falling back on instinct, they attempt to do what they’ve done for eternity: ferry people to the underworld, even if some of those people aren’t yet dead. There are angels, their ivory-white robes ripped andstained, that cluster in therafters of the Church of the Dark Mother and howl profanities at anyone who comes near. In the depths of the Lost Sepulchre, dead-eyed warrior maidens in rusted armour stagger blindly in search of souls worthy enough to carry to heaven on their long-dead winged steed. And in Cloven, the wild-children capture the mad, blind celestial horses that rampage through the overgrown streets and pluck their tattered wings to sell their feathers to occultists.|Very few of them remember their names; some have adopted names that they have overheard whilst hiding in the City Beneath.|Clutching a rusted celestial spear to their chest; Patching up tattered wings with birdshit and feathers; Eating the pages of a holy book, one by one.|To guide souls back to their respective underworlds, but the doorways are lost and the “souls” are whoever they find trespassing on their domains.|Standard|7|2|Tattered raiments (D6, Religion, Occult).|Broken celestial blades (Kill D6, Brutal).||Religion, Desolate.
FLIGHTLESS OWL HIVE|There’s a folk story about how Owl, in his hubris, tried to court the Moon Goddess back when Spire was young. He claimed that he was king of the skies and that she should be honoured to be his bride.She cursedhimandallhischildrentoneverflyagain, and only thesmallowlswereabletosneakawayfromher notice;even now, owls on the surface world will never land in a patch of moonlight. The larger owls were so ashamed that they learned the trick of burrowing so they could live beneath the earth and never have to set eyes on the moon ever again. That’s the story, anyway. The reality is that the Heart supports several hundred colonies of invasive, flightless owls. They operate in a hive structure like bees or ants,bringing back kills and regurgitating them into the mouths of scores of mewling, blind young. They’re larger than surface owls and more vicious: they work in packs to bring down a target many times their size,screeching and flapping dust into the air to confuse their prey. They’ll often set up shop beneath a settlement and start stealing food, then animals, then children and so on. It’s a fairly common first job for delvers to descend into the cramped tunnels beneath a haven and cull an owl hive;.Some superstitious types believe that a feather or bone from thefirstowltheyeverkillisagoodluckcharm,and even seasoned explorers will bear a dirty-white feather in their cap as a memento. It’s an easy enough job if you take out each group of guard owls quickly. Just don’t let them wake the hive; if they do,the guttural song of the queen will echo through the chambers,and the invaders should leave quickly unless they wish to be torn to pieces.|The individual owls don’t have names; each Queen’s name is a minute-long screech and only pronounceable by other owls.|Eating a weaker member of the hivewhole; Blind and operating by echo location; Mangy,with yellowing skin and patchy feathers.|To defend the Queen and ensure the safety of the hive.|Standard.|3|0|Assorted owl bones (D4, Occult)|Beaks and claws (D6)||Wild, but those owls aren’t the problem; they can be found in the Warren,Desolate and Haven domains too, which is when they come into conflict with people.
GHOST|Ghosts are a fact of life in the Heart. Between the weird energies flowing through the place and the capacity for sudden violent death,the odds of your spirit rising as a ghost after your death are pretty high. Most of the burial rites of the inhabitants focus around stopping this from happening. Ghosts (or phantoms, spectres or wraiths – there are a lot of names for them) tend to haunt something that was important to them in life. Most commonly they’ll take up residence in the building where they lived and try to drive out new tenants; other times, they’ll haunt an item that they owned, the weapon that killed them, their murderer or lover and so on. Not every ghost is malevolent, but many are; and most of those that aren’t are far removed from reality, thanks to their minds fracturing under the stress of death. You can put a ghost to rest by “solving” whatever unfinished business it has in the City Beneath or consecrating its remains, which allows it passage to its chosen afterlife. But not every ghost wants to move on. Some are actively fleeing judgement and making the most of their time trapped between worlds.|Old-fashioned names like Enriette, Gregorious, Burrage.|Trailing ectoplasm from fatal wounds; Appearing only in mirrors and reflections; Manifesting as a flash of cold and the sound of creaking ice.|It differs from ghost to ghost, but most are caught between abject loneliness and directionless rage.|If you can see them properly, Standard; otherwise, Risky.

Researching the specific item needed to affect a specific ghost allows the character to ignore the ghosts’ protection value and increases their stress inflicted by two steps (e.g. etching the ghost’s suicide note into your sword, wrapping their late husband’s hair around your wrists, trapping them in a room by pouring dirt from their grave into the keyholes).|Cursed, Occult, Religion.
GNOLL INCURSION TEAM|The Heart is of particular interest to occultists, theologists and fringe scientists from all over the world. Some of them even manage to reach and explore it within their lifetimes rather than just reading about it in books. As the gnolls who dwell in the deserts to the south are officially at war with the rulers of the City Above, the only way they can get their demonomechanical experts inside the City Beneath is to sneak in and hope they don’t get caught. Wearing special suits of sandwalker leather designed to withstand the wild energy of the Heart, teams of between six and ten gnolls explore the strangeness around them and document it on curious devices: shimmering spheres, light as soap-bubbles but strong as iron, that they say contain bound djinn of remembrance. Most of the inhabitants of the Heart let them get on with it, since they keep themselves to themselves for the most part. But each new moon, there is a standing bounty paid for the heads of gnolls delivered to the Derelictus central square each, which is doled out by serious-looking drow administrants from the City Above. The exploration teams do their best to keep their existence a secret and to silence anyone who might report them to the authorities.

GODBEAST|The Forest is an ancient heaven that slumbers beneath the earth waiting for the cities of the world to fall. Through it stalk creatures unlike any of those seen in the surface world: great elk, ten foot high at the shoulder with horns of stone and crystal; boars with tusks the size of a drow’s arm and muscles like steel hawsers; and monstrous dragonflies that buzz through the air with a low bass drone. On occasion, when a great hunter dies and their soul awakens in the Forest, the path between the ancient hunting ground and the real world opens, and godbeasts will step out in search of new food sources.

GREATER HEARTSBLOOD BEAST|These were animals once, but the energies of the Heart and generations of breeding have changed them into something protean and terrible. The smallest are the size of mice (they can shift their bodies into insubstantial shadowstuff, making them nearly impossible to hunt), but those that will pose a threat to delvers tend to be the size of stray dogs, feral pigs, or scavenging foxes. The Heart has no care for the original function of the creature’s limbs and organs. It’s common to see inverted creatures, their spines broken and bent, skittering crablike towards their prey. The limbs of others wither away, their ribcages blossoming out to form centipede-like legs that carry them forwards instead. A normal-looking deer might have, on closer inspection, no discernable mouth on its head; it’s only when it squats over food and disgorges its entire stomach from a ragged maw on its underbelly that it becomes apparent that something’s wrong. Some heartsblood creatures were never normal to start with. In the same way that the Heart is a collection of memories and fears made solid, these animals are flesh-echoes spun from the nightmares of the inhabitants. A bear has never made its way into the Heart, and yet there is one here – or a simulacrum of one, stitched together out of meat and dreams, a ragged imitation of a half-remembered glimpse. Folk stories persist of heartsblood creatures turning up to help injured travelers, especially if said travelers are favored of the Heart; these are mostly lies.

HEARTSEEDS|The Heart experiments. It has limitless power that some say even it doesn’t understand how to use. The shifting tunnels of the City Beneath and the malleable reality down there is one piece of evidence for this theory; another is heartseeds. These nodes of Heart energy are quietly birthed as wriggling, pallid maggots the size of a child’s forearm. They crawl from cracks in the earth, coalesce in forgotten cupboards and bury themselves secretly in the bodies of dead men. Once they feel like they’re in a good enough position, they will form a fleshy cocoon and pupate into something greater: a microcosm of the Heart itself, a testing ground designed to fail. As the cocoon swells and writhes, the area around the heartseed will begin to change. Walls twist and bend, water drips upward and animals crawl into ritual positions around it as they choke on their own liquefied organs. If undiscovered, the seed will grow and bloom intoaflowerofsorts.Bythispointtheareaaroundit will be behaving as if it were one tier deeper than it actually is, and reality will be coming apart at the seams. Gibberish words etch themselves into the|COMPANION. [Minor/Major,Echo] Seeing you as a fellow creature of the Heart,the beast comes to your aid. While this might be useful in the short-term (as it defends you from attackers, feeds you from its breast/regurgitates food into your mouth, leads you to safety, etc.) it will be a problem in the long term.

After a while, the flower will die. Someone will kill it in an attempt to normalise the surroundings or sell it to a collector,or it will be unable to sustain its pocket of unreality and wither away. But the Heart learns from it, if indeed it can be said to learn, and adapts its approaches to be more efficient next time. (Or perhaps more poetic? More terrifying? It is hard to understand what the Heart wants, or if it can want at all.) Heartseeds are akin to delvers in this respect: tendrils of something vast and other, exploring a strange environment and trying to bend it to their will. Approaching and handling a blossoming heartseed inflicts Echo stress – D8 on average, with more for those who try to pluck it out of the ground and transport it elsewhere. An intact and blooming heartseed is a D12 resource with the appropriate domain, and can be used to power rituals and blessings as though it had the Occult and Religion tags. A heartseed in its larval state is worth D10, because they often die during their metamorphosis if transported. APPEARANCE The appearance and effect of a heartseed depends on the domain it is pupating in: CURSED: A purple-black fleshy heart the size of a fist, strung up with sticky red cables of flesh and tendon, beating erratically. The Vermissian Sages say that you could pluck it out and, if you were quick enough, replace someone’s heart with it. This would be a terrible and very exciting way to die. DESOLATE: A patch of raw nothing sitting uneasily in a space where it simply cannot be – everything has to be something, and yet this exists (or, rather, doesn’t exist). It is best described as a sickening sensation that is felt in the stomach when observed; a void that doesn’t quite hurt your eyes to look at, but makes them feel strained, as though you’ve been crossing them. Desolate heartseeds attract the nihilistic worshippers of the Hungry Deep, who are eager to try and observe unalloyed nothingness. They will protect a nascent bloom with their lives. HAVEN: A drow child, huddled and shivering, at the centre of the chaos. They are rooted to the floor, and their palms are affixed to their clutched forearms with a thick, fibrous paste. They babble incoherently, recycling words they’veheardwhilstintheirlarvalstate.Theyare able to tell your name by looking directly into your eyes; this is the only real trick they know. OCCULT: A book or scroll with arcane-looking writing on it; a language you can half-read, or symbols that flit on the edge of your understanding. The pages are vellum-like and the words on them are, from a scholarly point of view, absolute bunkum. They hold no relevance to any ongoing esoteric theories, reference no known beings and don’t follow even the most basic ritual practice. But in the City Beneath, they work – to an extent. They use blood and bone magic akin to those practiced by the witches of Hallow, but they don’t require the user to be infected to cast them. RELIGION: An altar to no god in particular. Unlit candles give off a sickly, wan light regardless, and the images of saints and hallows seem to have been drawn by someone with only a passing understanding of humanoid anatomy. Close examination of the altar reveals it to be made of calcified bone and porous stone, and it’s covered in an astringent salt that inflicts wild hallucinations on anyone who gets it on their skin. TECHNOLOGY: A ticking, whirring clockwork device made from organic materials. Cogs are studded with teeth, belts wrought from loops of hair and skin,“glass” covers are transparent membranes.Though they look imperfect,each error and aberration is perfectly replicated, leading to a machine that is asymmetrical but staggeringly precise. WARREN: A carpet of slowly undulating and shifting mould that seeks out any biomass it can consume – fungus, primarily, but carrion and rotting plant matter are also good. At the centre of the slime colony is a writhing waist- high mass of yellow mould. It covers an area the size of a house in a thin layer of sticky acidic matter that eats away at everything it touches. Attempts to burn out the heartseed result in it panic-sporing,flooding the air with caustic cells in an attempt to escape. WILD: A plump lotus flower, writhing with energy, emitting waves of soporific musk. Animals will rush to feed on the nectar and pollinate it, which is inevitably fatal. The heartseed uses them as raw materials, controlling them with translucent feelers and rebuilding them into something new, which enjoys a brief and frantic life.|||||||||
MALE HARPY|Each male harpy is a magpie-like corvid about the size of a housecat, and they like to take sharp and shiny things from people. They tie the sharp things they take onto their beaks and talons to augment their dive-bombing method of catching prey. Older harpies have a wide array of knives, spear points, bayonets and cutlery attached to their pointed white beaks, and bent carpentry nails, fishing hooks and climbing pitons bound to their feet. One swooping from a cave roof can easily puncture the armour of an incautious delver. Harpies will gladly work in teams to dive-bomb a lone wanderer, quickly rendering them incapable of proper retaliation through pain and blood-loss. The shit-caked birds cackle and caw at their prey as it dies, and often imitate the sound of its death throes, as they are capable (and apparently cruel) mimics. They bring the shiny things back to their bowers: mating sites intended to attract the attention of a female. To a harpy, “shiny” seems to mean occult resonance – they have an instinctive attraction towards items that are used to augment magical spells. Necklaces bearing wicked sigils, black-wax candlesandtwo-headedgoatplacentahaveallbeen stolen from travellers and arranged around the harpy’s mating site in curious patterns. Once the harpy has gathered enough shiny things, it will kill smaller creatures – rats, mice, feral piglets, pitchkin – and drag their corpses back to its bower where it will mark summoning sigils in their blood on the stone floor. Then, working on instinct alone, the harpy will caw out a mating call using fragments of language that it does not understand, stolen from the throats of the dying. This draws the attention of a female. The female harpy is a different beast: a humanoid the height of a drow, with great wings where its hands would be, but no less filthy or callous than the male. The bowers act as summoning circles to draw them forth from whatever hellish dimensiontheydwellin.Theyemergethrougharift in the blood-soaked floor and mate with the male (an act which generally results in his death). Fromthere,theywillscreechforthandexperience the joys that the Heart has to offer: fresh prey, the terror on the faces of their victims, the feeling of flightaftereonsofconfinementintheirgrimdimension. They live on borrowed time, as the magic used to summon them is as bestial and instinctive as they are. Only more death and fear can keep them in the CityBeneath,orelsetheywillcrumbletodustastheir spiritsaredraggedbacktotheirotherworldlyprison. The female harpy will aim to slaughter her way to a haven, kill whoever she can inside and lay as many eggs as possible before her soul is claimed.

MARKET SERF|In the twisting depths of the Red Market, gangs of followers devoted to their Incarnadine masters carve out territory with bludgeon, sword and shot. To these serfs, their master is a godlike figure; they were all riddled with debt, and the Incarnadine saved them and their family from ruin in exchange for service. There are many households living comfortably in the lower levels of the City Above thanks to the good work of the Incarnadines and the bloody empires of trade and murder protected by their loyal serfs.|Nux Ab-Crowfer, Quin Ex-Hypatia, Boswell Of-Tennant (Serfs take their master’s given name as their surname, usually with a prefix.)|Pushing jagged shards of coins into their gums to act as teeth; Bears records of their master’s financial transactions like a banner; Chants price lists like sacred mantras.|To bring heaping bounties to the feet of their splendid and gracious lords.|Standard|5|0, or 1 for favoured serfs|Often: A few bloodied nail-like coins (D4, Haven); Rarely: Something you could use as leverage against their master (D10, Religion).|Rusted, jagged blades (D6, Unreliable); one per group will carry either a blessed coin-firing blunderbuss (D6, Point-blank, Spread, One-shot) or a heavy club studded with sacred transactions (D8, Tiring).||Warren, Religion.
MIRROR SPIDERS|In the dim and distant past of the world, a god fled into the Heart, fatally wounded from a thousand cuts. Shattered and broken, it turned into a thousand spiders, each with a shard of mirror on its back in a unique shape. These spiders fled through the Heart to try to evade capture from the god’s enemies. It worked; the spiders were not found. Each is a godlinginitsownright,andeachcultivatesasectof zealously devoted spiders and other, lesser insects around itself. They know that they can eat each other to gain power, and thattheycannotdiefromoldage.The largest and most powerful mirror spider has eaten seventy or so of its kin, and is the size of a dinner plate. (It is in the possession of a High Matriarch of the Church of the Moon Beneath, who uses it to do her hair; the spider believes the relationship to be a sort of marriage.) Mirror spiders themselves aren’t much of a threat, unless they’re huge. The real danger comes from their suicide cults of mad insects ready to give their lives for the living god that walks among them. That, and the fact that should they gather together, they’ll become a full- scale god once more.|Each has a fragment of the true name of their original god; the sort of unwritable syllables that leave a bad taste in your mouth and smoke hanging in the air.|Residing in a tiny temple of discarded newspaper; Sitting beneath a miniature idealised portrait of themselves,created by their followers; Has stuck shards of mirror onto their back to look more impressive to other spiders.|To find and consume other mirror spiders.If you can find someone who can speak to them, they’re often willing to bargain.|Standard|6 per swarm – you can crush any individual member of it without bother.|4.

PITCHKIN|These poor individuals were kicked out of the factories in the City Above because they were too ill to work. Spireblack, the flammable tar-like substance that collects in the eaves of factories, got into their lungs and ravaged their bodies with a black-vein sickness. They fled to the Heart and were warped by its energy until they formed a symbiotic relationship with the poison. Instead of killing them, it made them stronger (and took away their higher reasoning).|Each has a word marked on them which they now use as a name in their heavy, sussurating tongue: Vulpine, Wrath, Serrate, Quill.|Clinging to the underside of the ceiling with long black talons; Pausing to cough and retch up lumps of tar; Huge, jet- black eyes glinting in the darkness.|The pitchkin only want spireblack; they won’t bother you unless you threaten their supply.

SIGNAL-BOX CULTISTS|The Vermissian still has functioning signal-boxes: tiny rooms with mechanisms and lights that stutter into life, attempting to direct a train network that long ago slipped into a parasite dimension. Most of the information they give out is nonsense, and Vermissian Knights steer clear of them with a wariness that borders on superstition. But tunnel-dwellers – the luckless souls who make their homes in the infrastructure – view them as blind oracles that whisper secret truths to those brave enough to listen. The most devoted of these cults guard the signal- boxes, drape themselves in tattered raiments of the Vermissian (mouldering curtains from first-class carriages, rivets hammered into their bodies, implanted glass lenses over their eyes) and offer gibberish wisdom to vagrants in exchange for service or supplies.|Haslam, Levier, Forneau|Limbs reinforced with rusted pistons with weeping sores at the entry points; Chanting the names of Vermissian stations, some of which exist; Blind, carrying a legless cultist on their back who directs them|To induct others into the cult,to trade for supplies, ortoslitthethroatofaVermissian Knight and have them bleed out overthesignalmachinery.|Standard|4|0|AWAKE.

THE BLIGHTED|There is a parasite that gives trees the gift of awakening and curses them to insanity. Burrowing and festering deep within the wood,the parasite changes the tree’s biology to allow it to move on creaking dirt-caked legs of root and bark.They can think as quickly as the short-lived creatures that flit around it in the forests of their home. But the parasite is hungry, and eats the wood of the tree in which it lives. Specimens have rents in theirbarklinedwithwrithingfleshygrowthswhere they’ve been ravaged by it. The tree feels this sensation as an irritation at first, but as the parasite grows in power and mass,it builds to a overwhelming,unscratchable itch that drives the tree insane. The only way of stopping the itch is to give the parasite something else to eat, and even then, it is only temporary. Plant matter doesn’t work fast enough and the trees don’t want to risk further infection, so they hunt and kill other creatures, pressing the corpses against their festering wounds to calm the ravening sensation a little. Those that have been infected the longest lope through the forests with their kills impaled on their upper branches, occasionally pausing to tear off a rotting limb and hold it against themselves as they visibly relax. If the trees don’t consume their kills immediately, they gain some measure of control over the flesh via the parasite. Hands can grasp and manipulate; horrifically, faces can speak in the voices of their original owners. A blighted who’s managed to learn to speak through a stolen mouth is rare, and acts as a caretaker for other, less fortunate infected trees. If the blighted weren’t all insane, they might be able to form a culture and somehow communicate with the other inhabitants of the Heart; in the moments when their minds calm down enough, they sometimes realise the horror of what they’re doing. But the clarity doesn’t last for long, and it brings a guilt that’s as bad as the itch itself.|They don’t have, or really understand, names. Things are marked by their geographic location rather than a distinct moniker; where you are is what you are.|Carrying a twitching deer in its upper branches, letting the blood spill down over its wounds; Desperately trying to stand still amidst a copse of trees in ambush; Cradling a corpse to their “chest” as the parasite consumes it.|To get the itching to stop.|Standard|10|4 versus weapons that can’t chop down trees.|Parasite samples (D8, Cursed, Dangerous); Assorted equipment and bones from its kills (D6, Haven, Wild).|Impaling branches (D8).|Fire inflicts double stress when used against the Blighted.|Wild
THE CARNIVAL|The Carnival is eternal. Sometimes the dancers die – their feet battered and bloody, crawling through abandoned districts on hands and knees – but the Carnival itself endures. The Carnival is a brain-wyrm that makes sufferers dance, cavort and sing. It is a gift, a cruel reward, sung into the minds of the undercity by a misguided warrior- poet of the aelfir in the City Above. It is greater than the sufferers. Those who can write will scratch the words of it into walls, a word- salad nonsense that infects the reader. It hides in thechorusesoffolksongs,inthesingsonggamesof children,in the graffiti on gang territory.Occasionally infection will come to a head and an entire haven will take leave of their senses, drape themselves in colourful rags and skip through the Heart, singing the virus aloud to bewitch and lure in passers-by. There’s nothing malicious about them; honestly, even though they’re malnourished and their feet are ruined with blisters, they seem genuinely happy.There are far worse ways to die down here. The Carnival is not the only brain-wyrm to enter the Heart. Mummer-Pox causes sufferers to act out a great aelfir play that can only be performed over millennia, and this was deemed to be the most effective method of staging it. The Labyrinth Curse compels the infected to construct complex mazes riddled with traps around things it deems “unsafe.” Scrivener’s Lament forces those that carry it to write book after book, all attributed to the same author.|Gregor, Yolande, Klimpt|Shaking a noise-maker made out of pebbles in a glass bottle; Carrying a severely malnourished (but uninfected) infant on their back; Daubing a shaky mural depicting the carnival onto the wall nearby in white paint.|To dance!

THE CULT OF KNIVES|There is a room where the knives that long for blood go. Ifadagger isusedin enough murders,it’llgeta taste for it.It will nudge and tweak the hand of its owner, begging to be plunged back into warm wet flesh and feel the shuaddering of a last breath. For a knife, a murder is heaven – an ecstatic joy, a sharp and sudden power, a sense of purpose fulfilled. Knives who kill enough people start to realise that it is they, the “tools,” that hold the power – not the people who carry them. They begin their own crusades against those they hate, often changing hands several times throughout a string of murders. Even though they are incapable of moving under their own power,they will warp the minds of those that hold them and call out to others of the same kind. They will begin to plot; they will form a cult. ThisishowyouwillmeettheCultofKnives:inan unassumingbasementorattic,whilstsearchingfor something long thought lost, you will find a wide- eyed man or woman who has apparently stabbed themselves with thirteen or so knives and left them lodged inside their body.

THE WALKING WOUNDED|Years ago – maybe even a century – the 33rd Regiment of the Allied Defence Force were sent into the City Below to pacify the Heart. Some of them went AWOL and would go on to form the Hounds as they are today; most weren’t that lucky. You hear tell of what happened as you work your way down a bottle of rotgut liquor and huddle around the trashfires for warmth. They are horror stories even for denizens of the Heart: legends of unimaginable cruelty on the part of the 33rd’s mad aelfir officers, themselves protected by shimmering wards and implanted saints’ bones, marching at the head of columns of deranged and mind-blasted soldiers. You hear whispers of doomed assaults on heartsblood enclaves and encroaching angels; of the walls of the City Beneath coming alive and crushing – chewing – the poor bastards to pulp; of the flesh and bone of the troopers coming untethered and rewriting itself in hideous new shapes. The worst thing, they say, is that the least fortunate of all never died. They can’t. In their final moments of torment and confusion and panic, they bonded with the eternal energy of the Heart.|You’ll see them at the edge of a haven: rendered senseless, bandages over ruined eyes, hands on each others’ shoulders, limping in a line to Goddess knows where. If you’re brave enough to approach them, you’ll realise that they aren’t a line of soldiers – they’re all one mass of flesh, hand- stumps fused to shoulders, ancient iron pistols melded with puckered skin and twisting bone.
