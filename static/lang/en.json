Instead, the designers must rely on substitutes: the combined intelligences of twenty pigeons, perhaps, or one of the carrion-swine that plague the settlements of the City Beneath.</p>\n<p>These automatons follow their owners and carry their effects, so they’re popular with the reclaimers who dig into the depths of the Vermissian in search of treasure or sellable junk. Generally, you’ll see them attached to their master via a chain or rope, but some can detect sigils stamped into the ground: by carving a unique symbol into the base of their staff, a reclaimer can mark a path for their automaton as they walk along. Some older traders ride them, sitting cross-legged on their backs while surrounded by black candles, tapping ahead of the beast with a stick so it can follow the noise.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, automatons will wander away from their owner, or their owner will die, leaving them masterless. These are highly-prized treasures, and rumors of ramshackle constructs shuddering through the city laden with lost riches are popular in taverns and drug-dens all throughout the Heart.</p>",

It’s a bastard thing to do, and in havens where they’re used, most inhabitants try not to think about it.

The bigger problem is when mating season rolls around.

They’re larger than surface owls and more vicious: they work in packs to bring down a target many times their size, screeching and flapping dust into the air to confuse their prey.</p>\n<p>They’ll often set up shop beneath a settlement and start stealing food, then animals, then children and so on.

The Heart has no care for the original function of the creature’s limbs and organs. It’s common to see inverted creatures, their spines broken and bent, skittering crablike towards their prey. The limbs of others wither away, their ribcages blossoming out to form centipede-like legs that carry them forwards instead. A normal-looking deer might have, on closer inspection, no discernable mouth on its head; it’s only when it squats over food and disgorges its entire stomach from a ragged maw on its underbelly that it becomes apparent that something’s wrong. Some heartsblood creatures were never normal to start with. In the same way that the Heart is a collection of memories and fears made solid, these animals are flesh-echoes spun from the nightmares of the inhabitants. A bear has never made its way into the Heart, and yet there is one here – or a simulacrum of one, stitched together out of meat and dreams, a ragged imitation of a half-remembered glimpse.

They bring the shiny things back to their bowers: mating sites intended to attract the attention of a female.

Burrowing and festering deep within the wood, the parasite changes the tree’s biology to allow it to move on creaking dirt-caked legs of root and bark. They can think as quickly as the short-lived creatures that flit around it in the forests of their home. But the parasite is hungry, and eats the wood of the tree in which it lives. Specimens have rents in theirbarklinedwithwrithingfleshygrowthswhere they’ve been ravaged by it. The tree feels this sensation as an irritation at first, but as the parasite grows in power and mass, it builds to a overwhelming, unscratchable itch that drives the tree insane. The only way of stopping the itch is to give the parasite something else to eat, and even then, it is only temporary. Plant matter doesn’t work fast enough and the trees don’t want to risk further infection, so they hunt and kill other creatures, pressing the corpses against their festering wounds to calm the ravening sensation a little. Those that have been infected the longest lope through the forests with their kills impaled on their upper branches, occasionally pausing to tear off a rotting limb and hold it against themselves as they visibly relax. If the trees don’t consume their kills immediately, they gain some measure of control over the flesh via the parasite. Hands can grasp and manipulate; horrifically, faces can speak in the voices of their original owners. A blighted who’s managed to learn to speak through a stolen mouth is rare, and acts as a caretaker for other, less fortunate infected trees. If the blighted weren’t all insane, they might be able to form a culture and somehow communicate with the other inhabitants of the Heart; in the moments when their minds calm down enough, they sometimes realise the horror of what they’re doing. But the clarity doesn’t last for long, and it brings a guilt that’s as bad as the itch itself.</p>\n",

In its centre, the aelfir architects who built the Vermissian com‐ missioned an enormous station to link the City Above and the City Beneath and allow travel between them. Haven sta‐ tion, as it was to be called, was built but never connected to the line. After decades of delays, it was abandoned and the inhabitants of Derelictus moved in. Huge, arching ceilings of broken and filthy glass tower above the central plaza. There are three plat‐ forms that extend downwards into the void below, each housing hundreds of people, and the station continues into the outskirts of Derelictus proper. Here, the racial tensions of Spire are relaxed some‐ what by the interzone feel of the place; aelfir associ‐ atewith–andonoccasionmarry–darkelves. The central platforms form the crux of the City Between, as Derelictus is sometimes called – they cater to delvers, thrill-seekers, occultists, vagabonds andexplorersallkeentodescendintotheHeart. Platform 1 is a warren devoted to the very serious business of selling people things that will help them survive in the Heart. Workshops and traders boast the keenest swords, the warmest coats and the cleanest-burning spireblack. The goods for sale are expensive; the owners have a captive audience, after all. Platforms 2 and 3 cater to the baser needs of delvers – the roughest ale, the greasiest food, the cheapest beds and the cheapest company. Finally, platform 4 holds representatives from most of the factions who have a vested interest in Heart exploration. The Vermissian Collective boastsanintactticketofficehere;theHoundshave a recruitment office; and the Gryndel Hunting Clubs offer farewell drinks to members before a delve. Any number of paramilitary, religious, occult or trade-related organisations have offices on the platform, whether publically or not.Spending a few days in Derelictus automatically removes all stress from a character’s resistances.There’s work to be had for able-bodied people and those who can read and write. Doesn’t pay very well though (D4, Haven). Various dark magicians kicked out of the City Above but not quite ready for the City Below practice their dark arts on the crumbling streets of Derelictus.If you can break into their hovels you can make off with their valuables – sacrificial animals, sheafs of arcane research notes, scrying-bones and so on (D8, Occult). Hunting the verminous swine that snuffle through the open sewers here is a popular pastime, and if you get a big one someone will generally buy it off you (D6, Wild).

Like many deep- dwellers, they implant animal material into their bodies; elder Labyrinthines have rows and rows of horns on their head, neck and back. People would be happy to leave them alone, but they have an instinctive desire to build their structures around important things – or steal those things and put them deep inside the maze so no-one can reach them. They don’t appear to get any use out of these resources, but instead enjoy “protecting” them from others. This is not a huge problem when their walls stop heartsblood creatures from emerging from a cave, but it’s a serious inconvenience when you return to a haven to find it surrounded by twisting passages and razorwire traps.Doctors aren’t entirely sure how the Labyrinth disease is transmitted between hosts. It might be blood-borne or air‐ borne, but it could just as likely be a mimetic virus contracted by exposure to mazes.

A few wild-eyed men and women pray to the spirits of the birds or commune with the majesty of a bee swarm’s hive-mind, but most end up dead or in the City Beneath, where civilisation comes undone and their bestial sides can flourish. The druids of Redcap are,unlike the ones you’d find in your average sacred stone circle or wilder‐ ness grove, unrepentant criminals. Realising that their arcane arts gave them access to a) fast- growing plants,no matter the location,and b) the ability to turn into dangerous predators when they needed to, they established the undercity’s most prolific and best-guarded drug farm and flooded the market with magic mushrooms. Anyone who tried to muscle in on their racket (or who tried to stop them for noble reasons) ended up on the wrong side of a hit squad of half-an‐ imal, half-drow assassins. Redcap, which looks to be built upon the ruins of an ancient cathedral, is now a lurid smear of fungal blooms and the air is thick with spores. The druids (and a few ungifted lackeys) keep watch over their stocks of mushrooms and escort shipments up to Red Row in the City Above. On occasion, they also release a few luckless sacri‐ fices into the caverns beneath that they can hunt and kill, ensuring another good harvest as their blood soaks into the porous rock.Non-druids, or people who aren’t part of the wider organisation,generally aren’t too welcome within Redcap Grove.

This was a perfect example of the Damnic virtue of Fury, and the temple of Chollerous was regarded as a sacred site for the worshippers of the Moon Beneath. At least, that’s the official story.

She is still a visionary architect in the City Beneath following her exile, and now she is free from petty constraints like organisational oversight, the fundamental nature of space and time or zoning laws. Ventrix had a vision of a grand unified society where everyone had a place and no-one was surplus to requirements. She would spend days in commu‐ nion with ant and bee hives, marvelling at their organisation; she studied under gnollish geoman‐ cers, worked with ostracised retro-architects from the Eastern Domain and ate corpsefruit from ancient lineages to dream of days past. She courted and mined the brains of the finest artists and thinkers that aelfir society had to offer. At the summer festival in the year of Terrible Feathers, she unveiledhercreationtothepublic:anentireredesign of Spire intended to have it function as the perfect society,withsatisfactionandcontentmentforall. This was too much for high elf society to bear. They considered themselves far better than the other races of the world, and Ventrix’s proposal threatened to undermine the strength of their dominion if the powerful ideas within ever reached the public at large. She was exiled, and though secret support from her patrons contin‐ ued, she was not allowed to set foot in the frozen halls of Amaranth ever again. Ventrix fled to the undercity,and from there to the Heart. She understood what she had to do: the minds of aelfir society could not comprehend the weight of her suggestions if they remained purely theoretical. She required an experiment; a model society, a microcosm of her ideal nation, that she could present to the council to change their minds.She began construction of the tower. Thatwasaroundfifteenyearsago,buttimemoves strangely in the Heart, and Ventrix herself feels as though she has been at work for a century or more. Her creation – simply referred to as the Tower by thosewholiveinornearit–isnearlycomplete. Thirty storeys high, the Tower takes up the entirety of the vast cave in which it was built. Each level has space for between five and ten families, and these families are responsible for different elements of sustaining the colony. A tiny copy of the Garden District takes up three floors,with res‐ idents’ beds suspended over the algae vats that feed the Tower. Tiny workshops handle the cre‐ ation of work tools, spireblack refinement and construction materials. In the open-air plazas of the mid-levels, libraries and volunteer teachers seek to educate the residents on matters of art and critical thought, and the greatest plays of the last few centuries are performed by enthusiastic (if unskilled) players.In the upper levels,Ventrix her‐ self and a wide collection of advisors consult to determine the best path forward for the colony. She rarely sleeps – instead, she tirelessly works to better the lives of those inside, and prepares for the day when she will reveal her work to the coun‐ cil in the City Above. What’s strange about the Tower is that it works. There aren’t quite enough people in there (over half of the apartments are empty) and it faces prob‐ lems from thieves and heartsblood monsters, but the residents are happy. The society ticks along just fine with Ventrix at the head, and it expands year on year. Is it due to her socialist policies? Per‐ haps. Is it due to the architectural magic woven into the bones of the building, geomantic wards and hexes rewriting the brains of those who spend more than a few days inside? Maybe. Is it due to the spiritual energy of a thousand beehives fixed in place, ordering the minds of the inhabitants into perfect co-operation? It’s hard to say. Ventrix makes no secret of the nature of the Tower, and her heart seems to be in the right place – even if her perfect society is one that requires no-one ever leave due to dissatisfaction. She is as much a prisoner of her magic as every‐ one else inside. There is no dark secret, no under‐ handed plot – just straightforward mind control in service of the perfect city. On occasion, delvers are asked to “rescue” people who’ve moved to the Tower, and they always find them unwilling to leave. Indeed, these delvers – should they spend significant time within the structure – often get involved in the community themselves and join up,forsaking everything they once were. They’re perfectly happy to do so.",

Don’t mistake this for a friendly place, though. The bazaar drains people of their positive traits – the ability to trade them back and forth is a side- effect of the place’s hunger. The traders use other people’s traits to stay in the game, but there’s a reason that most of them are unapproachable, mean-tempered deviants: the bazaar has taken more from them than they’d like.You can trade advances your character has in exchange for advances from other classes at a cost of D4 Mind stress for a minor advance and D6 Mind stress for a major advance.

The winding, warrenous corridors outside of the small inner sanctum are riddled with traps that maim and cut and tear, but do not kill. Those who join the temple must walk this labyrinth blindfolded, over and over, until they can step through it without triggering any of the cruel devices that are hidden in the walls and floor. The highest amongst them are far from pristine; they bear scars, missing fingers or hands and mangled feet from these traps. To them, their flesh was graceless, and Lombre blessed them by removing it so that they might understand her better."

A nameless wizard – one of the ancient Sorcerer-Kings who conjured demon-towersfromthenakedearthintheBlastedAgeoftheHomeNations – postulated that, just as bees sup nectar from flowers, there must be an insect that can plunge its proboscis in the ear of a dreamer and siphon off its sweetness. Perhaps, he thought, that’s how ideas spread with suchspeedthroughapopulace!Thisdoesn’texactlymakesense,but the wizard was so deep in a dozen demonic bargains that rhyme hadbeguntoreplacereasoninhisshatteredpalaceofamind. There are fragments of his various ideas scattered throughout the world, and several of those are in the Heart,where the walls between real and unreal are thin indeed. Papilious is one such place: an extra-dimen‐ sional fracture, accessed by encouraging a particu‐ lartypeofmothtogentlyprobeyourearinsearch of delicious secrets, then following it as it flits around the City Beneath. Eventually, though you will not notice the change, you will be standinginoneofthemanydoorwaysto Papilious:thehomeofthemoth-keep‐ ers and the guardians of their lore books. Upon first impressions, Papilious seems like an idyllic place. Moths, their bodies loaded with insubstantial pollen taken from the consciousnesses of those nearby, are brushed with soft-bristled tools.Once loosened,the pollen is carefully spread inside the pages of blank books, where it miraculously begins to take the shape of words, pictures and formulae incomprehensible to all but the most learned scholars. Several of the greatest minds of the City Above have visited Papilious in search of wisdom, and they have found it. The keepers sell spare dust from the moths as a mind-sharpening drug, and invest the takings into magical wards and defences to keep Papilious safe. But as you explore, the library will shift and twist into something else: there are two Papiliouses, each stored within the other. Towering archives become tumbledown wretched dens where desperate people sell access to the darkest recesses of their brains; benevolent librarians become monstrous, cruel priests devoted to har‐ vesting secrets and bearing the eggs of their masters on their exposed necks; and the pursuit of wisdom is inverted into a rapacious desire for forbidden, harmful knowledge. Spymasters and dark magicians buy (or steal) secrets from the cultish guardians, and more than one delver has met their end here in a mad quest for enlightenment. Opening the wrong door in the benevolent version will lead you to the malevolent one, and vice versa – but neither set of inhabitants gives any credence to the ridiculous theory that an entire inverted version of their own reality sits on the other side of a doorway or down a winding corridor. It is entirely possible to become lost within Papilious –indeed,it seems that many of the inhab‐ itantshavedonejustthat,anddecidedtostay.The siphoned-off paper-thin dreams of madmen (D4,Occult,Niche) Inscrutable books of wisdom and prophecy (D6, Occult, Religion, Niche) Bag of moth-dust (D8, Occult.

Should a delver find Vanishing Point, the mid‐ point between the two places, they can venture into this paper-thin Spire (after passing their doppleganger,who had the same idea at the same time) and explore – perhaps even bringing back uncanny relics of the place. The Vermissian Sages have a vested interest in Unspire: they claim that the Heart Itself was never pierced there, and so the train network was not pitched into impossible chaos."

A modest afterlife might amount to a three-bed‐ room apartment, nice curtains, all the malak you can stand to take and access to a delightful shared garden; but a high priest’s reward could be a man‐ sion wrought from floating iron that sings with the wind, a fountain that sprays beautiful artwork made from water in prismatic bursts and a feast‐ ing table that is always full of delicious food and drink.These places are stitched together with eph‐ emeral streets and corridors, and it’s considered a boon to get into a good part of heaven rather than slumming it with the proles in the lower levels. But Azur and Incarnadine, the twin gods of the place, claim that running an afterlife costsmoney(thoughtheydon’tsaywhere they’respendingit).Whensomeoneruns outofcashinheaven,theyarepolitelybut firmlyescortedoffthepremisesandrein‐ carnated as a poverty-stricken newborn.
