Drow live to around a hundred years of age, but the cruel conditions of Spire means that few of them reach 50. Drow do not give birth to viable young – instead, they lay fist-sized fleshy eggs that must be tended to for months until they develop into an infant. Drow regularly find their way into the Heart, either actively fleeing Spire or trying to find someone or something to call their own in the depths. Some are pilgrims tracing fragmented maps to find the Moon Beneath, tired of the state-mandated religions in Spire. The Drow of Spire predominantly worship Our Glorious Lady, a facet of their on ce-tripartite moon goddess; venerating the other two facets is forbidden. This religion focuses on six primary virtues, and it is considered good and proper for a drow to live their life in accordance with them: Community, Sagacity, Fury, Grace, Tenacity and Vigilance.",

Humans live brief but bright lives in the eyes of the elves, passing away at 60 or so, often from illness or injury. The discovery of spireblack processing and the resulting rise in arms manufacture is almost entirely their doing.

Aelfir in the City Above wear masks to hide their faces from their inferiors; in the City Beneath, only traditionalists wear them. In the City Above, their rule is cruel and capricious; it is self-serving and deleterious to those around them. When adventuring into the City Below, most aelfir know that they lost any authority as soon as they passed through Derelictus. Many have adjusted to their new place in life.

In the confines of the Heart, where the gaps between realities are thin, they can achieve unthought-of results in mechanoccultism – and great machines from ages past thrum and whirr in the hidden depths, just waiting to be found. Gnolls have a reputation for being angry, bestial warriors – but a lot of this is propaganda on the part of the aelfir, and they’re no more warlike than any other people.

By using material scavenged from the broken alternate realities of the Vermissian (and from even weirder machines buried deeper beneath the earth), the creators of these devices can imbue them with basic intelligence via occult rituals. Some have the mind of a horse or ox bound into them, but such beasts are hard to come by in the Heart. Instead, the designers must rely on substitutes: the combined intelligences of twenty pigeons, perhaps, or one of the carrion-swine that plague the settlements of the City Beneath.</p>\n<p>These automatons follow their owners and carry their effects, so they’re popular with the reclaimers who dig into the depths of the Vermissian in search of treasure or sellable junk. Generally, you’ll see them attached to their master via a chain or rope, but some can detect sigils stamped into the ground: by carving a unique symbol into the base of their staff, a reclaimer can mark a path for their automaton as they walk along. Some older traders ride them, sitting cross-legged on their backs while surrounded by black candles, tapping ahead of the beast with a stick so it can follow the noise.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, automatons will wander away from their owner, or their owner will die, leaving them masterless. These are highly-prized treasures, and rumors of ramshackle constructs shuddering through the city laden with lost riches are popular in taverns and drug-dens all throughout the Heart.</p>",

But their appetite is nothing compared to the carrion- pig: an enormous beast, easily the size of a horse and hugely fat, that eats absolutely anything organic you throw near its mouth. Carrion-pigs are popular methods of waste disposal in the Heart. Catch one (if you’re brave enough), lock it in a cellar, throw anything vaguely edible down there, and it’ll gobble it up in seconds.

It’s a bastard thing to do, and in havens where they’re used, most inhabitants try not to think about it.

The bigger problem is when mating season rolls around. Picking up the scent of huge and fecund females trapped underneath havens, males will gather on nearby outcroppings of rock and bellow a deep-throated call that makes windows shake. Should the female carrion-pig hear this, she’ll thrash around against the confines of her prison and – if it’s not well-built enough – destroy it, smash apart a good section of the haven with it, and romp off in search of her lover-to-be.</p>",

The reality is that the Heart supports several hundred colonies of invasive, flightless owls. They operate in a hive structure like bees or ants, bringing back kills and regurgitating them into the mouths of scores of mewling, blind young. They’re larger than surface owls and more vicious: they work in packs to bring down a target many times their size, screeching and flapping dust into the air to confuse their prey.</p>\n<p>They’ll often set up shop beneath a settlement and start stealing food, then animals, then children and so on. It’s a fairly common first job for delvers to descend into the cramped tunnels beneath a haven and cull an owl hive. Some superstitious types believe that a feather or bone from the first owl they ever kill is a good luck charm, and even seasoned explorers will bear a dirty-white feather in their cap as a memento.

While this might be useful in the short-term (as it defends you from attackers, feeds you from its breast/regurgitates food into your mouth, leads you to safety, etc.) it will be a problem in the long term. Unless you or a friend kills it (and it will be very upset if you try), it will break into havens to kill people and pets, then bring you their mutilated corpses as gifts. walls; fields of broken glass hang in midair, glintinglikestars;fireburnscold, ornotatall;sound ispluckedfromthemouthsofspeakersandfunneled towardsthecentreofthespace. After a while, the flower will die. Someone will kill it in an attempt to normalise the surroundings or sell it to a collector, or it will be unable to sustain its pocket of unreality and wither away. But the Heart learns from it, if indeed it can be said to learn, and adapts its approaches to be more efficient next time. (Or perhaps more poetic? More terrifying? It is hard to understand what the Heart wants, or if it can want at all.) Heartseeds are akin to delvers in this respect: tendrils of something vast and other, exploring a strange environment and trying to bend it to their will. Approaching and handling a blossoming heartseed inflicts Echo stress – D8 on average, with more for those who try to pluck it out of the ground and transport it elsewhere. An intact and blooming heartseed is a D12 resource with the appropriate domain, and can be used to power rituals and blessings as though it had the Occult and Religion tags. A heartseed in its larval state is worth D10, because they often die during their metamorphosis if transported. APPEARANCE The appearance and effect of a heartseed depends on the domain it is pupating in: CURSED: A purple-black fleshy heart the size of a fist, strung up with sticky red cables of flesh and tendon, beating erratically. The Vermissian Sages say that you could pluck it out and, if you were quick enough, replace someone’s heart with it. This would be a terrible and very exciting way to die. DESOLATE: A patch of raw nothing sitting uneasily in a space where it simply cannot be – everything has to be something, and yet this exists (or, rather, doesn’t exist). It is best described as a sickening sensation that is felt in the stomach when observed; a void that doesn’t quite hurt your eyes to look at, but makes them feel strained, as though you’ve been crossing them. Desolate heartseeds attract the nihilistic worshippers of the Hungry Deep, who are eager to try and observe unalloyed nothingness. They will protect a nascent bloom with their lives. HAVEN: A drow child, huddled and shivering, at the centre of the chaos. They are rooted to the floor, and their palms are affixed to their clutched forearms with a thick, fibrous paste. They babble incoherently, recycling words they’veheardwhilstintheirlarvalstate.Theyare able to tell your name by looking directly into your eyes; this is the only real trick they know. OCCULT: A book or scroll with arcane-looking writing on it; a language you can half-read, or symbols that flit on the edge of your understanding. The pages are vellum-like and the words on them are, from a scholarly point of view, absolute bunkum. They hold no relevance to any ongoing esoteric theories, reference no known beings and don’t follow even the most basic ritual practice. But in the City Beneath, they work – to an extent. They use blood and bone magic akin to those practiced by the witches of Hallow, but they don’t require the user to be infected to cast them. RELIGION: An altar to no god in particular. Unlit candles give off a sickly, wan light regardless, and the images of saints and hallows seem to have been drawn by someone with only a passing understanding of humanoid anatomy. Close examination of the altar reveals it to be made of calcified bone and porous stone, and it’s covered in an astringent salt that inflicts wild hallucinations on anyone who gets it on their skin. TECHNOLOGY: A ticking, whirring clockwork device made from organic materials. Cogs are studded with teeth, belts wrought from loops of hair and skin, “glass” covers are transparent membranes.Though they look imperfect, each error and aberration is perfectly replicated, leading to a machine that is asymmetrical but staggeringly precise. WARREN: A carpet of slowly undulating and shifting mould that seeks out any biomass it can consume – fungus, primarily, but carrion and rotting plant matter are also good. At the centre of the slime colony is a writhing waist- high mass of yellow mould. It covers an area the size of a house in a thin layer of sticky acidic matter that eats away at everything it touches. Attempts to burn out the heartseed result in it panic-sporing, flooding the air with caustic cells in an attempt to escape. WILD: A plump lotus flower, writhing with energy, emitting waves of soporific musk. Animals will rush to feed on the nectar and pollinate it, which is inevitably fatal. The heartseed uses them as raw materials, controlling them with translucent feelers and rebuilding them into something new, which enjoys a brief and frantic life."

Older harpies have a wide array of knives, spear points, bayonets and cutlery attached to their pointed white beaks, and bent carpentry nails, fishing hooks and climbing pitons bound to their feet. One swooping from a cave roof can easily puncture the armour of an incautious delver. Harpies will gladly work in teams to dive-bomb a lone wanderer, quickly rendering them incapable of proper retaliation through pain and blood-loss. The shit-caked birds cackle and caw at their prey as it dies, and often imitate the sound of its death throes, as they are capable (and apparently cruel) mimics. They bring the shiny things back to their bowers: mating sites intended to attract the attention of a female. To a harpy, “shiny” seems to mean occult resonance – they have an instinctive attraction towards items that are used to augment magical spells. Necklaces bearing wicked sigils, black-wax candlesandtwo-headedgoatplacentahaveallbeen stolen from travellers and arranged around the harpy’s mating site in curious patterns. Once the harpy has gathered enough shiny things, it will kill smaller creatures – rats, mice, feral piglets, pitchkin – and drag their corpses back to its bower where it will mark summoning sigils in their blood on the stone floor. Then, working on instinct alone, the harpy will caw out a mating call using fragments of language that it does not understand, stolen from the throats of the dying.

The tree feels this sensation as an irritation at first, but as the parasite grows in power and mass, it builds to a overwhelming, unscratchable itch that drives the tree insane. The only way of stopping the itch is to give the parasite something else to eat, and even then, it is only temporary. Plant matter doesn’t work fast enough and the trees don’t want to risk further infection, so they hunt and kill other creatures, pressing the corpses against their festering wounds to calm the ravening sensation a little. Those that have been infected the longest lope through the forests with their kills impaled on their upper branches, occasionally pausing to tear off a rotting limb and hold it against themselves as they visibly relax. If the trees don’t consume their kills immediately, they gain some measure of control over the flesh via the parasite. Hands can grasp and manipulate; horrifically, faces can speak in the voices of their original owners. A blighted who’s managed to learn to speak through a stolen mouth is rare, and acts as a caretaker for other, less fortunate infected trees. If the blighted weren’t all insane, they might be able to form a culture and somehow communicate with the other inhabitants of the Heart; in the moments when their minds calm down enough, they sometimes realise the horror of what they’re doing.

You hear tell of what happened as you work your way down a bottle of rotgut liquor and huddle around the trashfires for warmth. They are horror stories even for denizens of the Heart: legends of unimaginable cruelty on the part of the 33rd’s mad aelfir officers, themselves protected by shimmering wards and implanted saints’ bones, marching at the head of columns of deranged and mind-blasted soldiers. You hear whispers of doomed assaults on heartsblood enclaves and encroaching angels; of the walls of the City Beneath coming alive and crushing – chewing – the poor bastards to pulp; of the flesh and bone of the troopers coming untethered and rewriting itself in hideous new shapes. The worst thing, they say, is that the least fortunate of all never died. They can’t. In their final moments of torment and confusion and panic, they bonded with the eternal energy of the Heart.</p>\n",
